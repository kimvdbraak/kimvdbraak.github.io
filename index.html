        <p>Web accessibility refers to the practice of designing and developing websites and web-based applications in a
          way that makes them usable and accessible to all individuals, including those with disabilities. This includes
          ensuring that web content can be easily understood, navigated, and interacted with by people with a wide range
          of abilities and disabilities, including those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers.</p>

        <p>This Eppi Mapper generated map conforms to the World Wide Web Consortium's Web Content Accessibility
          Guidelines (<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/" target="_blank">W3C WCAG</a>) Version
          2.1 Level AA to the maximum extent possible. These guidelines explain how to make web content more accessible
          for people with disabilities. The features in this map include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>If the default settings have been used when generating this map, the overall colour design has been set to
            a more visually contrasting appearance.</li>
          <li>Links in the application have been converted to buttons to accommodate screen readers.</li>
          <li>Aria status updates now inform screen readers when modals open and selected records change.</li>
          <li>Tab focus is contained within opened modals.</li>
          <li>The style selection functionality has been moved to the top menu for easier access.</li>
          <li>A new style, Textual view, has been added to the map. This view presents the record counts within each
            node in a text readable format.</li>
          <li>URL links for individual records have been made descriptive.</li>
          <li>The map generation tool will inform the user if the selected background and font colour contrast meet
            accessibility requirements.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p><b>Limitations</b></p>
        <p>At the present time, while the keyboard focus does stay within each opened modal, the focus cannot be moved
          to individual checkboxes or radio buttons or, in the View Records modal, to all fields in the full record.
          This means that those items, along with the nodes in the map, can only be selected using a mouse or pointing
          device. In future updates we hope to address this limitation.</p>

Results: The search conducted produced a total of 1,296 records: 1,106 from PubMed; 90 from Web of Science; 54-Scopus and 46- Science direct. Seven themes emerged thus: Resources and infrastructure; Inadequate facilities and capacity building; Funding problem; Collaboration and teamwork; Curriculum reform; professional regulation; and nursing culture. Conclusions: It is evidently apparent that in order to ensure improved quality and quantity of production, and the adoption of EBP in the care, developmental partners and government have to increase the allocation of fund for infrastructural development, teaching and learning materials as well as hospital facilities to create an enabling environment for the smooth running of the evidenced practice in Nursing.","Comments":"L2020427614 2022-10-12\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Abdullahi K O; Ghiyasvandian S ; Hasanpour M ; Nayeri N D; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.53350/pjmhs22168384","Keywords":"Africa south of the Sahara\r\nMedline\r\nScienceDirect\r\nScopus\r\nWeb of Science\r\nadoption\r\ncapacity building\r\ncurriculum\r\nevidence based practice center\r\nfunding\r\ngovernment\r\nhuman\r\nhuman experiment\r\nlearning\r\nnursing education\r\nreview\r\nrunning\r\nsystematic review\r\nteaching\r\nteamwork","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Abdullahi K O, Ghiyasvandian S, Hasanpour M, and Nayeri N D (2022) Challenges of Evidence-Based Practice and Nursing Education in Sub Saharan Africa: An Integrative Review.

We sought to systematically assess coverage of the five EBP steps, review the outcome domains measured, and assess the properties of the instruments used in studies evaluating EBP educational interventions. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of controlled studies (i.e. studies with a separate control group) which had investigated the effect of EBP educational interventions. We used citation analysis technique and tracked the forward and backward citations of the index articles (i.e. the systematic reviews and primary studies included in an overview of the effect of EBP teaching) using Web of Science until May 2017. We extracted information on intervention content (grouped into the five EBP steps), and the outcome domains assessed. We also searched the literature for published reliability and validity data of the EBP instruments used. RESULTS: Of 1831 records identified, 302 full-text articles were screened, and 85 included. Of these, 46 (54%) studies were randomised trials, 51 (60%) included postgraduate level participants, and 63 (75%) taught medical professionals. EBP Step 3 (critical appraisal) was the most frequently taught step (63 studies; 74%). Only 10 (12%) of the studies taught content which addressed all five EBP steps. Of the 85 studies, 52 (61%) evaluated EBP skills, 39 (46%) knowledge, 35 (41%) attitudes, 19 (22%) behaviours, 15 (18%) self-efficacy, and 7 (8%) measured reactions to EBP teaching delivery. Of the 24 instruments used in the included studies, 6 were high-quality (achieved >=3 types of established validity evidence) and these were used in 14 (29%) of the 52 studies that measured EBP skills; 14 (41%) of the 39 studies that measured EBP knowledge; and 8 (26%) of the 35 studies that measured EBP attitude. CONCLUSIONS: Most EBP educational interventions which have been evaluated in controlled studies focus on teaching only some of the EBP steps (predominantly critically appraisal of evidence) and did not use high-quality instruments to measure outcomes. Educational packages and instruments which address all EBP steps are needed to improve EBP teaching.","Comments":"Albarqouni, Loai Hoffmann, Tammy Glasziou, Paul\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Albarqouni L ; Hoffmann T ; Glasziou P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-018-1284-1","Keywords":"*Educational Measurement/mt [Methods]\r\n*Evidence-Based Practice/ed [Education]\r\nHumans\r\nReproducibility of Results","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Albarqouni L, Hoffmann T, and Glasziou P (2018) Evidence-based practice educational intervention studies: a systematic review of what is taught and how it is measured.

EBP mentors address organizational barriers and promote the translation of evidence into clinical practice at the bedside. AIM: To evaluate research findings related to EBP mentor development programs, to identify effective practices, and to assess the outcomes associated with EBP mentor development programs. METHODS: A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted to retrieve studies from CINAHL, PubMed, and Scopus, using keywords and subject headers related to EBP mentorship and quality and safety outcomes. Studies were appraised and reviewed to compare mentor program composition and examine clinician, organizational, and patient outcomes. RESULTS: Fifteen studies met inclusion criteria: one randomized control trial (RCT), one literature review, eleven descriptive studies, and two case reviews. Most programs included didactic content, an EBP project with coaching, and resources to support learning. The studies found that these programs led to improvements in clinicians' EBP beliefs, practices, and abilities, the organization's readiness for EBP, and patient safety.

METHODS: Systematic searches carried out in five databases and handsearching were used to identify the studies from 2010 to 2016, with a populations, exposures and outcomes (PEO) search strategy, focusing on the question: In which databases or other information resources do hospital nurses search for evidence based information, and how often? RESULTS: Of 5272 titles retrieved based on the search strategy, only nine studies fulfilled the criteria for inclusion. The studies are from the United States, Canada, Taiwan and Nigeria. The results show that hospital nurses' primary choice of source for evidence based information is Google and peers, while bibliographic databases such as PubMed are secondary choices. Data on frequency are only included in four of the studies, and data are heterogenous.

We aimed to systematically review the major relevant articles in case of barriers and facilitators to implementing evidence-based practice in health services. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The type of study was a systematic review. We searched the libraries and online sources such as PubMed, MEDLINE, Wiley, EMBASE, ISI Web of Knowledge, Scopus, Science Direct, Cochrane Library, and Google scholar. We used keywords included \"Evidence-Based Practice\", \"Evidence-Based Management\", \"Healthcare\", \"Care Management, Evidence-Based Healthcare Management\", \"Health Care\", Health\", \"Barrier\", \"Facilitator\", policy and \"Evidence-Based Healthcare\". RESULTS: In total, 12 studies were included. Several barriers and facilitators were recognized through the included papers, the factors such as organization support and a helpful education system improved skills, knowledge, and confidence to EBP. The outcomes of studies were identified as the employ of the internet as a highest-rated skill for increasing EBP quality. CONCLUSION: Generally, the results showed health service administrators should first identify barriers of EBP then transferred them to facilitators to the implementation of proper and efficient EBP.","Comments":"Ayoubian, Ali Nasiripour, Amir Ashkan Tabibi, Seyed Jamaledin Bahadori, Mohammadkarim\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ayoubian A ; Nasiripour A A; Tabibi S J; Bahadori M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.31661/gmj.v9i0.1645","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ayoubian A, Nasiripour A A, Tabibi S J, and Bahadori M (2020) Evaluation of Facilitators and Barriers to Implementing Evidence-Based Practice in the Health Services: A Systematic Review.

The objective of this overview of systematic reviews (SR) was to update evidence and assess the effects of various approaches for teaching evidence-based health care (EBHC) at undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate (PG) medical education (ME) level on changes in knowledge, skills, attitudes and behaviour. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This is an update of an overview that was published in 2014. The process followed standard procedures specified for the previous version of the overview, with a modified search. Searches were conducted in Epistemonikos for SRs published from 1 January 2013 to 27 October 2020 with no language restrictions. We checked additional sources for ongoing and unpublished SRs. Eligibility criteria included: SRs which evaluated educational interventions for teaching EBHC compared to no intervention or a different strategy were eligible. Two reviewers independently selected SRs, extracted data and evaluated quality using standardised instrument (AMSTAR2). The effects of strategies to teach EBHC were synthesized using a narrative approach. Previously published version of this overview included 16 SR, while the updated search identified six additional SRs. We therefore included a total of 22 SRs (with a total of 141 primary studies) in this updated overview. The SRs evaluated different educational interventions of varying duration, frequency, and format to teach various components of EBHC at different levels of ME (UG, PG, mixed). Most SRs assessed a range of EBHC related outcomes using a variety of assessment tools. Two SRs included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) only, while 20 reviews included RCTs and various types of non-RCTs. Diversity of study designs and teaching activities as well as aggregated findings at the SR level prevented comparisons of the effects of different techniques. In general, knowledge was improved across all ME levels for interventions compared to no intervention or pre-test scores. Skills improved in UGs, but less so in PGs and were less consistent in mixed populations. There were positive changes in behaviour among UGs and PGs, but not in mixed populations, with no consistent improvement in attitudes in any of the studied groups. One SR showed improved patient outcomes (based on non-randomised studies). Main limitations included: poor quality and reporting of SRs, heterogeneity of interventions and outcome measures, and short-term follow up. CONCLUSIONS: Teaching EBHC consistently improved EBHC knowledge and skills at all levels of ME and behaviour in UGs and PGs, but with no consistent improvement in attitudes towards EBHC, and little evidence of the long term influence on processes of care and patient outcomes. EBHC teaching and learning should be interactive, multifaceted, integrated into clinical practice, and should include assessments.

To be able to facilitate EBP implementation, valid measurement of the \"EBP status quo\" is essential. Therefore, we aimed to identify valid tools for EBP status assessment among occupational, physical and speech therapists in Germany. METHODS: The databases PubMed, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and CINAHL were systematically searched from August 2011 until July 2022. Methodological quality and evidence level were scored by two independent raters via: i) the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) checklist, ii) updated criteria for good measurement properties, and iii) modified GRADE criteria. RESULTS: Overall, 57 reports describing the development or validation of 31 EBP questionnaires were included. Six questionnaires showed \"sufficient\" evidence for content validity, three questionnaires showed \"sufficient\" evidence for reliability, two questionnaires showed \"sufficient\" evidence for structural validity as well as internal consistency, and nine questionnaires showed \"sufficient\" evidence for construct validity. Most questionnaires demonstrated moderate or low-quality evidence for the psychometric properties tested. DISCUSSION: Overall, the present review found a lack of sufficient evidence on the psychometric properties of most questionnaires. The Evidence-Based Practice Inventory (EBPI), the Evidence-based Practice Confidence (EPIC) scale and the Health Sciences-Evidence-Based Practice (HS-EBP) questionnaire were the only questionnaires with \"sufficient\" content validity and, in addition, \"sufficient\" reliability or \"sufficient\" internal consistency. CONCLUSION: Although a lack of high-quality psychometric properties of EBP tools became apparent, the EBPI, the EPIC scale and the HS-EBP questionnaire currently appear to be the best validated tools to assess EBP behavior/attitude and implementation in occupational, physical and speech therapists.","Comments":"Balzer, Julia Jung, Andres Gerhard, Janina Reinecke, Sarah Mijic, Marko Fichtmuller, Andrea Jahjah, Akram Eggert, Marieke Koch, Maren Ernst, Kathrin Haring, Robin S1865-9217(22)00203-3\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Balzer J ; Jung A ; Gerhard J ; Reinecke S ; Mijic M ; Fichtmuller A ; Jahjah A ; Eggert M ; Koch M ; Ernst K ; Haring R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.zefq.2022.11.003","Keywords":"*Evidence-Based Practice\r\n*Speech\r\nGermany\r\nHumans\r\nPsychometrics\r\nReproducibility of Results\r\nSurveys and Questionnaires","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Balzer J, Jung A, Gerhard J, Reinecke S, Mijic M, Fichtmuller A, Jahjah A, Eggert M, Koch M, Ernst K, and Haring R (2023) Psychometric properties of questionnaires to assess evidence-based practice among occupational, physical and speech therapists: A systematic review.

The identification of essential knowledge, skills and attitudes for EIPM can support the development of competency profiles and their application in different contexts. PURPOSE: To identify elements of competency (knowledge, skills and attitudes) for EIPM, according to different professional profiles (researcher, health professional, decision-maker and citizen). METHODS: Rapid umbrella review. A structured search was conducted and later updated in two comprehensive repositories (BVSalud and PubMed). Review studies with distinctive designs were included, published from 2010 onwards, without language restrictions. Assessment of the methodological quality of the studies was not performed. A meta-aggregative narrative synthesis was used to report the findings. RESULTS: Ten reviews were included. A total of 37 elements of competency were identified, eight were categorized as knowledge, 19 as skills and 10 as attitudes. These elements were aggregated into four competency profiles: researcher, health professional, decision-maker and citizen. The competency profiles included different sets of EIPM-related knowledge, skills and attitudes. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: This study is innovative because it aggregates different profiles of competency from a practical perspective, favouring the application of its results in different contexts to support EIPM. Methodological limitations are related to the shortcuts adopted in this review: complementary searches of the grey literature were not performed, and the study selection and data extraction were not conducted in duplicate. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: EIPM requires the development of individual and organizational capacities. This rapid review contributes to the discussion on the institutionalization of EIPM in health systems. The competency profiles presented here can support discussions about the availability of capacity and the need for its development in different contexts.","Comments":"Barreto, Jorge Otavio Maia Romao, Davi Mamblona Marques Setti, Cecilia Machado, Maria Lucia Teixeira Riera, Rachel Gomes, Romeu da Silva, Silvio Fernandes\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Barreto J O.

The scientist–practitioner model underpins postgraduate psychology training programs. During such programs, clinical supervision plays an important role in the development and acquisition of evidence‐based practice and scientist–practitioner competence. Objective: The primary objective of this study was to provide a comprehensive, current, and systematic review of the empirical research on supervisory interventions or practice that monitored and/or shaped the development of scientist–practitioner competence among psychology trainees. The secondary objective was to conduct a critical appraisal and assess the methodological rigour of included studies. Methods: Four major electronic databases were systematically searched against a priori inclusion criteria. Eligible quantitative studies investigated were located and assessed to identify evidence‐based practice and scientist–practitioner factors within supervision in the psychology training settings. Results: A large pool of studies was retrieved but only four studies (N = 724 participants) met inclusion criteria indicating a major gap in the area. A narrative synthesis was conducted. Included studies were of good methodological quality, had small to medium sample sizes, and produced significant and valid results. Included studies used competency evaluation rating forms and compared supervision interventions. Conclusions: Despite the large body of literature on supervision, this review highlights a lack of empirical investigations into evidence‐based practice and scientist–practitioner competence within supervision during psychology training. Future research directions are provided, and recommendations and implications for training and supervision are discussed.","Comments":"research; systematic review.

METHODS: Relevant databases were searched systematically with appropriate search terms up to September 2017. References of the articles detected by the search were screened for any new articles. Risk of bias was assessed by two independent reviewers. Data were extracted from the full-text articles based on the study summary measures and were collected in a data table. RESULTS: Fifty-seven articles were finally included in this systematic review. The studies were of variable and moderate quality. Based on our results, physicians have a generally positive attitude toward EBM and most of them believe that its implementation improves patient care. However, their self-reported awareness and knowledge regarding EBM concepts and the main databases are generally poor. The major barriers to the practice of EBM were related to patient overload and lack of personal time, knowledge, and skills rather than a lack of facilities and resources. However, this pattern varied among the studies. Most of the physicians in the included studies referred to their colleagues and textbooks to answer most of their clinical questions. CONCLUSION: Although many physicians have poor EBM knowledge and skills, the majority of them have a positive attitude toward the implication of EBM. To overcome the barriers against the evidence-based practice, it is recommended that appropriate policies be adopted to decrease physicians' workload and to provide them with preappraised evidence.","Comments":"Barzkar, Farzaneh Baradaran, Hamid Reza Koohpayehzadeh, Jalil\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Barzkar F ; Baradaran H R; Koohpayehzadeh J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jebm.12325","Keywords":"*Attitude of Health Personnel\r\n*Evidence-Based Medicine\r\n*Health Knowledge\r\n*Physicians/px [Psychology]\r\nAttitudes\r\nClinical Competence\r\nHumans\r\nPractice\r\nTime Factors\r\nWorkload","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Barzkar F, Baradaran H R, and Koohpayehzadeh J (2018) Knowledge, attitudes and practice of physicians toward evidence-based medicine: A systematic review.

In this study, considerations of how to break down the barriers are discussed in order to find new ways to develop and strengthen evidence-based practice. AIMS: The objective of the study was to identify nurses' perceptions of barriers to research utilization in clinical practice between the years of 2000 and 2018 and across continents by reviewing studies that used the Barriers to Research Utilization (BARRIERS) scale (Appl Nurs Res, 4, 1991, 39). DESIGN: A systematic review of observational studies based on Joanna Briggs specific guidelines. METHODS: A systematic search to identify and select eligible studies was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and SCOPUS during January 2019. Google Scholar was also searched to identify additional studies using the Funk et al. (Appl Nurs Res, 4, 1991, 39) BARRIERS scale. An instrument for quality appraisal was constructed for this paper by combining two similar and previously used cross-sectional study checklists (Int J Sociol Soc Policy, 23, 8, 2003; Implement Sci, 5, 32, 2010). Descriptive statistics were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics (version 25). RESULTS: The 27 included studies were conducted in 16 countries across five continents and 11,276 nurses participated. Seven of the top 10 barriers were comprised of organizational factors. These organizational barriers were consistent over time and the five continents, with 56% of the listed top 10 barriers falling under the organizational category. From the year 2000 to 2008, the majority of the studies were conducted in Europe and Australia. However, for the next 10 years (2008-2018), the majority of studies were conducted in Asia, Africa, and North America. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: To break down the nurses' barriers to research utilization, our future practice and research focus will be to conduct intervention studies focusing on the effect of facilitators and contextual environment, as well as developing nursing research cultures in clinical practice with support from the nursing management.","Comments":"Berthelsen, Connie Holge-Hazelton, Bibi\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Berthelsen C ; Holge-Hazelton B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/wvn.12488","Keywords":"*Implementation Science\r\n*Organizational Culture\r\nAttitude of Health Personnel\r\nHumans","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Berthelsen C, and Holge-Hazelton B (2021) The Importance of Context and Organization Culture in the Understanding of Nurses' Barriers Against Research Utilization: A Systematic Review.

BACKGROUND: Although managers and environmental ward culture have long been identified as being among the main barriers to evidence-based practice, there is little overall conceptualization and understanding of the specific role of nurse leaders in directly influencing and supporting this. EVALUATION: The team carried out an integrative literature review (n = 28) utilizing PubMed, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library (2006-2016). KEY ISSUES: The key role of leadership, the methodology used, and understanding and addressing barriers to or facilitators of the implementation of evidence-based practice emerged as key issues. CONCLUSION: Nurse managers have a particular influential role on the implementation of evidence-based practice in terms of providing a supportive culture and environment. For this they need to have an underlying knowledge but also to be aware of and address barriers to implementation, and understand the key role of nurse managers in creating and supporting the optimum environment. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Nurse managers need to facilitate and enhance nurses' use of evidence-based practice. Both managers and nurses need to have the necessary academic preparation, support and resources required for practising using an evidence base.","Comments":"Bianchi, Monica Bagnasco, Annamaria Bressan, Valentina Barisone, Michela Timmins, Fiona Rossi, Silvia Pellegrini, Ramona Aleo, Giuseppe Sasso, Loredana\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bianchi M ; Bagnasco A ; Bressan V ; Barisone M ; Timmins F ; Rossi S ; Pellegrini R ; Aleo G ; Sasso L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.12638","Keywords":"*Evidence-Based Practice/mt [Methods]\r\n*Leadership\r\n*Nurse's Role/px [Psychology]\r\nEvidence-Based Practice/is [Instrumentation]\r\nHumans\r\nNurse Administrators/st [Standards]\r\nNurse Administrators/td [Trends]\r\nQuality Improvement","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bianchi M, Bagnasco A, Bressan V, Barisone M, Timmins F, Rossi S, Pellegrini R, Aleo G, and Sasso L (2018) A review of the role of nurse leadership in promoting and sustaining evidence-based practice.

To synthesize understanding, we undertook a systematic review of studies of middle managers' role in healthcare EBP implementation and determinants of that role. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE/PubMed and Business Source Complete (Ebsco) for literature on middle managers' role in healthcare EBP implementation and its determinants. We abstracted data from records that met inclusion criteria (i.e., written in English, peer-reviewed, and reporting either a protocol or results of an empirical study) into a matrix for analysis. We summarized categorical variables using descriptive statistics. To analyze qualitative data, we used a priori codes and then allowed additional themes to emerge. RESULTS: One hundred five records, spanning across several countries and healthcare settings and relating to a range of EBPs, met our inclusion criteria. Studies of middle managers' role in healthcare EBP implementation and its determinants substantially increased from 1996 to 2015. Results from included studies suggest that middle managers shape implementation climate in addition to fulfilling the four roles hypothesized in extant theory of middle managers' role in implementation. However, extant studies offered little understanding of determinants of middle managers' role. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that middle managers may play an important role in facilitating EBP implementation. Included studies offered little understanding regarding the relative importance of various roles, potential moderators of the relationship between middle managers' roles and EBP implementation, or determinants of middle managers' role in EBP implementation. Future studies should seek to understand determinants and moderators of middle managers' role. Clearer understanding may facilitate the translation of evidence into practice.","Comments":"Birken, Sarah Clary, Alecia Tabriz, Amir Alishahi Turner, Kea Meza, Rosemary Zizzi, Alexandra Larson, Madeline Walker, Jennifer Charns, Martin\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Birken S ; Clary A ; Tabriz A A; Turner K ; Meza R ; Zizzi A ; Larson M ; Walker J ; Charns M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13012-018-0843-5","Keywords":"*Administrative Personnel\r\n*Evidence-Based Practice/og [Organization & Administration]\r\n*Implementation Science\r\n*Leadership\r\n*Professional Role\r\nDiffusion of Innovation\r\nHealth Services Research\r\nHumans\r\nInformation Dissemination\r\nOrganizational Innovation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Birken S, Clary A, Tabriz A A, Turner K, Meza R, Zizzi A, Larson M, Walker J, and Charns M (2018) Middle managers' role in implementing evidence-based practices in healthcare: a systematic review.

However, the role of MMs who function as KBs (MM KBs) in health care is under-studied. Research is needed that contributes to our understanding of how MMs broker knowledge in health care and what factors influence their KB efforts. METHODS: We used a critical interpretive synthesis (CIS) approach to review both qualitative and quantitative studies to develop an organizing framework of how MMs enact the KB role in health care. We used compass questions to create a search strategy and electronic searches were conducted in MEDLINE, CINAHL, Social Sciences Abstracts, ABI/INFORM, EMBASE, PubMed, PsycINFO, ERIC and the Cochrane Library. Searching, sampling, and data analysis was an iterative process, using constant comparison, to synthesize the results. RESULTS: We included 41 articles (38 empirical studies and 3 conceptual papers) that met the eligibility criteria. No existing review was found on this topic. A synthesis of the studies revealed 12 MM KB roles and 63 associated activities beyond existing roles hypothesized by extant theory, and we elaborate on two MM KB roles: 1) convincing others of the need for, and benefit of an innovation or evidence-based practice; and 2) functioning as a strategic influencer. We identified organizational and individual factors that may influence the efforts of MM KBs in healthcare organizations. Additionally, we found that the MM KB role was associated with enhanced provider knowledge, and skills, as well as improved organizational outcomes. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that MMs do enact KB roles in healthcare settings to implement innovations and practice change. Our organizing framework offers a novel conceptualization of MM KBs that advances understanding of the emerging KB role that MMs play in healthcare organizations. In addition to roles, this study contributes to the extant literature by revealing factors that may influence the efforts and impacts of MM KBs in healthcare organizations. Future studies are required to refine and strengthen this framework.

The specific objectives were to (1) identify survey instruments testing EBP knowledge, skills, attitudes and behaviour; (2) determine the attributes measured by each instrument; (3) evaluate the psychometric properties of the instruments; and (4) evaluate the methodological quality of the instruments. Using the Cochrane approach, searches were conducted in Pubmed, EBSCOHost and Scopus from inception to February 2014. Papers were screened by two independent assessors, and data were extracted by one researcher. Forty papers reporting 34 instruments met the inclusion criteria and were included in the qualitative synthesis. Most instruments measured EBP behaviour (n = 33) and attitudes (n = 21). This review provides a single source of information to enable researchers to select the most robust descriptive instruments to measure EBP learner attributes. Instruments used only with occupational therapists may have resulted in some instruments being missed. For further research, it is recommended that attention is given to developing objective instruments with a focus on knowledge and skills.

RESULTS: The search resulted in 363 articles, including nine primary studies. The sources of recurrent evidence among care nurses were: personal experience and local care protocols. These professionals presented weaknesses in the implementation of the Evidence-Based Practice related to the lack of knowledge for evidence evaluation, work overload and resistance to change of practice. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: Nurses presented favorable attitudes, however, with little knowledge to perform the Evidence-Based Practice. Results can support interventions for its implementation in the hospital.","Comments":"Camargo, Fernanda Carolina Iwamoto, Helena Hemiko Galvao, Cristina Maria Pereira, Gilberto de Araujo Andrade, Raymann Benzi Masso, Giovanna Crispim S0034-71672018000402030\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Camargo F C; Iwamoto H H; Galvao C M; Pereira G A; Andrade R B; Masso G C; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1590/0034-7167-2016-0617","Keywords":"*Evidence-Based Nursing/st [Standards]\r\n*Health Knowledge\r\n*Nursing Care/mt [Methods]\r\nAttitudes\r\nClinical Competence/st [Standards]\r\nHumans\r\nNursing Care/st [Standards]\r\nPractice","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Camargo F C, Iwamoto H H, Galvao C M, Pereira G A, Andrade R B, and Masso G C (2018) Competences and Barriers for the Evidence-Based Practice in Nursing: an integrative review.

However, EBM teaching and learning approaches is quite heterogeneous. Hence, we aimed to conduct a meta-synthesis to identify various teaching and learning aspects of EBM from the learners and instructors perspective. Methodology: This study followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Guidelines. A comprehensive search strategy was used to retrieve articles from PubMed/Medline and Embase from inception till June 2022. To find additional studies, bibliographic search of included studies, review articles, a random search in Google Scholar, Research Gate and Google were carried out. This review evaluated studies published in English language that explained the teaching and learning aspects of EBM among healthcare professionals and students. Result: A total of 41 out of 8139 studies were included in this study. Both learners and instructors preferred tutorials, lectures, short courses, and workshops on EBM as a teaching method. To continue learning and practicing EBM, instructors suggested curricular changes as well as continuing education programmes. Learners preferred to learn EBM by direct clinical practice along with peers. Blended learning, group activities, assignments, workshops, journal clubs, task based learning, didactic teaching, team based learning, problem based learning, case based learning, blended learning, flipped learning and E-learning were the identified pedagogical approaches for teaching EBM. Conclusion: Different pedagogical approaches are used for teaching EBM among healthcare professionals. Continuous education programs for skill development must be held on a regular basis to improve the instructors and learners competency in EBM. Learners and instructors preferred learning approach should be considered while designing EBM educational studies as it is a life-long self-directed learning process.","Comments":"L2023809665 2023-04-13\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chandran V P; Balakrishnan A ; Rashid M ; Khan S ; Devi E S; Kulyadi G P; Nair S ; Thunga G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cegh.2023.101280","Keywords":"Embase\r\nEnglish (language)\r\nMedline\r\nPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses\r\nclinical practice\r\ne-learning\r\neducation program\r\nevidence based medicine\r\nhealth student\r\nhuman\r\nhuman experiment\r\nlearning\r\nmedical education\r\nmeta analysis\r\npractice guideline\r\nproblem based learning\r\nreview\r\nsearch engine\r\nself-directed learning\r\nskill\r\nsynthesis\r\nsystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chandran V P, Balakrishnan A, Rashid M, Khan S, Devi E S, Kulyadi G P, Nair S, and Thunga G (2023) Teaching and learning strategies of evidence based medicine: A meta-synthesis of learners and instructors perspective.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to identify the state of evidence on implementation in Chinese nursing contexts and to determine gaps that need to be pursued. METHODS: We performed a scoping review on existing literature on implementation studies conducted in nursing context in Mainland China. After systematically searching eight (four Chinese and four English) databases, we extracted and analyzed data from the included studies. RESULTS: Ninety-five articles met inclusion criteria. Publications were on the rise, with most funding from academic institutions. Most studies were quantitative, with patient outcomes as primary indicators. Eighteen studies used a theoretical framework. Frequently used strategies and barriers to evidence-based nursing implementation were mainly from the organizational level. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review indicates an urgent requirement of Chinese evidence-based nursing resources, more funding and support from clinical managerial level, cooperation between academic and clinical institutes, and a call for more rigorous studies of implementation science under a Chinese nursing context.","Comments":"Cheng, Lei Feng, Sheng Hu, Yan S0029-6554(16)30170-1\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cheng L ; Feng S ; Hu Y ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.outlook.2016.07.016","Keywords":"*Evidence-Based Nursing/og [Organization & Administration]\r\n*Evidence-Based Nursing/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data]\r\nChina\r\nHumans","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cheng L, Feng S, and Hu Y (2017) Evidence-based nursing implementation in Mainland China: A scoping review.

Although all nurses have a responsibility to implement EBP at an individual patient level, nurse practitioners (NPs) as clinical leaders have additional responsibilities in leading and collaborating with transdisciplinary teams to implement EBP across patient groups and embed practice change into routine care. AIM: To explore the factors affecting the implementation of EBP into routine care by NPs. Specifically, to examine NP beliefs, levels of EBP implementation, and barriers and enablers to EBP implementation into routine care. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted using the Arksey and O'Malley (International Journal of Social Research Methodology, 8, 2005, 19) framework. The electronic databases CINAHL, Medline, and PsycINFO were searched for studies published between 2009 and 2018 along with gray literature and reference lists of included articles. Abstracts and studies were screened using predefined eligibility criteria. Data extraction was undertaken using a standardized framework and data synthesis completed. RESULTS: Seven studies were included in the review. Findings indicated NPs valued EBP and believed it to be important in standardizing patient care. NPs' implementation of EBP was found to be relatively low overall. It was not possible to fully determine the extent to which NPs implemented EBP into routine care. NPs experienced similar barriers to EBP implementation as do nurse generalists such as lack of time, lack of EBP competence, lack of support from colleagues and managers, and inadequate resources. In particular, NPs identified collaborative practice issues as factors affecting EBP implementation. Identified barriers included physician-driven practice and the need to maintain professional and political boundaries. Supportive collaborative relationships and having professional confidence were identified facilitators. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: An exploration of NPs' experience of interprofessional collaboration when implementing EBP into routine care is needed to identify requirements for support in this area.","Comments":"Clarke, Vanessa Lehane, Elaine Mulcahy, Helen Cotter, Patrick\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Clarke V ; Lehane E ; Mulcahy H ; Cotter P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/wvn.12510","Keywords":"*Leadership\r\n*Nurse Practitioners/td [Trends]\r\nEvidence-Based Practice/mt [Methods]\r\nHumans","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Clarke V, Lehane E, Mulcahy H, and Cotter P (2021) Nurse Practitioners' Implementation of Evidence-Based Practice Into Routine Care: A Scoping Review.

However, analysis of the skill of physiotherapists in undertaking the steps of EBP, or the impact of EBP on the work of physiotherapists is limited. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a scoping review into physiotherapists performing the steps of EBP. DATA SOURCE: Literature concerning the skill of physiotherapists in EBP between 1990 and June 2013 was searched using AMED, Academic Search Complete, CINAHL, PubMed, ERIC, PEDRO and EMBASE databases. STUDY SELECTION: Twenty-five studies (six qualitative, one mixed methods and 18 quantitative) were selected. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Quantitative and qualitative data were extracted using two appraisal tools to analyse each of the five steps of EBP. RESULTS: Limited evidence exists to show that physiotherapists undertake the full EBP process. Despite formulating clinical questions and acquiring literature-based evidence, the drivers for conducting literature or evidence searches have not been clarified. The critical appraisal step was mainly assessed in the form of recognition of statistical terms. Only examples of guideline usage support the reflective final assessment step. Physiotherapists report using their peers and other trusted sources in preference to literature, primarily due to time but also due to divergence between the literature-based evidence and other evidence that they use and value (tacit knowledge). A positive impact of EBP on patient outcomes is lacking. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the information needs of physiotherapists may be necessary before adoption of the EBP process. The use of professional networks may offer a better means to identify knowledge gaps and translate acquired knowledge into practice, rather than focusing on individual skills in EBP.","Comments":"Condon, C McGrane, N Mockler, D Stokes, E Comment in (CIN) S0031-9406(15)03810-9\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Condon C ; McGrane N ; Mockler D ; Stokes E ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physio.2015.06.003","Keywords":"*Evidence-Based Practice\r\n*Physical Therapists\r\n*Physical Therapy Specialty/mt [Methods]\r\nAttitudes\r\nHealth Knowledge\r\nHumans\r\nPractice","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Condon C, McGrane N, Mockler D, and Stokes E (2016) Ability of physiotherapists to undertake evidence-based practice steps: a scoping review.

Several studies investigated important characteristics in EBP by physiotherapists and systematic review is needed. Therefore the aim of this study is to describe the current evidence on EBP knowledge, skills, behaviour, opinions and barriers by physiotherapists. Searches were conducted on MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PSYCINFO, LILACS, and SciELO in September 2014. We retrieved quantitative cross-sectional studies that investigated EBP knowledge, skills, behaviour, opinions, and barriers in physiotherapy. Risk of bias was assessed using a scale to evaluate representativeness of the sample, response rate, the accuracy of the data, evidence of power calculation and the instrument used. The search yielded 12,392 potentially eligible studies. Of these, 12 studies were included in the review (pooled sample = 6411 participants). In 3 studies that analysed knowledge, approximately 21-82% of respondents claimed to have received prior information on EBP. In 2 studies that reported skills and behaviour, nearly half of the sample had used databases to support clinical decision-making. In 6 studies that investigated opinions, the majority of the samples considered EBP necessary or important. The barriers most frequently reported were: lack of time, inability to understand statistics, lack of support from employer, lack of resources, lack of interest and lack of generalisation of results. Although the majority of physiotherapists have a positive opinion about EBP, they consider that they need to improve their knowledge, skills and behaviour towards EBP.

Methods: PubMed, MEDLINE, CINHAL, and Google Scholar were used to identify seven articles. Articles were included for review if they were published within the past 10 years (English only) and investigated barriers to EBP implementation in palliative care. Results: Four barriers were identified: (a) time and resource constraints, (b) lack of readiness for organizational change, (c) negative attitudes toward palliative care, and (d) process-specific difficulties. Conclusion: This systematic review's findings can inform policy changes to improve the uptake of EBP in palliative care.","Comments":"Dakka, Falah Jamal\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dakka F J; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1177/23779608221142957","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dakka F J (2022) Nurses Barriers to Evidence-Based Practice in Palliative Care: A Systematic Review.

BACKGROUND: Midwifery is a research-informed profession. However, a gap persists in the translation of best available evidence into practice settings, compromising gold standard maternity care and delaying the translation of new knowledge into everyday practice. DESIGN: A five-step integrative review approach, based on a series of articles published by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) for conducting systematic reviews, was used to facilitate development of a search strategy, selection criteria and quality appraisal process, and the extraction and synthesis of data to inform an integrative review. METHODS: The databases CINAHL, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Implementation Science Journal and Scopus were searched for relevant articles. The screening and quality appraisal process complied with the PRISMA 2009 checklist. Narrative analysis was used to develop sub-categories and dimensions from the data, which were then synthesised to form two major categories that together answer the review question. RESULTS: The six articles reviewed report on midwives' use of best available evidence in Australia, the UK and Asia. Two major categories emerged that confirm that although midwifery values evidence-based practice (EBP), evidence-informed maternity care is not always employed in clinical settings. Additionally, closure of the evidence-to-practice gap in maternity care requires a multidimensional approach. CONCLUSION: Collaborative partnerships between midwives and researchers are necessary to initiate strategies that support midwives' efforts to facilitate the timely movement of best available evidence into practice. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Understanding midwives' use of best available evidence in practice will direct future efforts towards the development of mechanisms that facilitate the timely uptake of latest evidence by all maternity care providers working in clinical settings.","Comments":"De Leo, Annemarie Bayes, Sara Geraghty, Sadie Butt, Janice\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"De Leo A ; Bayes S ; Geraghty S ; Butt J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15027","Keywords":"*Midwifery/og [Organization & Administration]\r\n*Nurse Midwives/og [Organization & Administration]\r\nCooperative Behavior\r\nEvidence-Based Nursing/mt [Methods]\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nPregnancy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"De Leo A, Bayes S, Geraghty S, and Butt J (2019) Midwives' use of best available evidence in practice: An integrative review.

AIMS: To establish a set of core EBP competencies for nurses and the most important EBP learning outcomes encompassing attitudes, knowledge, and skills dimensions for implementation into nursing education in European countries. METHODS: A multi-phase modified Delphi survey was conducted: Phase 1, a literature review; Phase 2, a two-round consensus of experts; and Phase 3, a Delphi survey. Experts from six European countries participated. RESULTS: In Phase 1, 88 records were selected and 835 statements extracted, which were grouped according to the seven steps of EBP. After removing 157 duplicates, the remaining competencies (n = 678) were evaluated in Phase 2. Then, a two-round expert consensus was reached, with 24 competencies and 120 learning outcomes identified and divided into affective, cognitive, and skills domains. In Phase 3, based on a Delphi survey expert consensus, all evaluated statements were included in a final set of competencies and learning outcomes. Only two learning outcomes were recommended for allocation to a different domain, and four were reformulated as suggested, with no further changes to the others. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: The set of EBP competencies and learning outcomes can guide nurse educators, managers, and EBP stakeholders in the development of content that incorporates EBP knowledge, skills, and attitudes into educational programs. Prioritizing the EBP competencies and learning outcomes that are most necessary and adapting them to every context will provide healthcare organizations with guidelines for enhancing the continuing education of nurses. These results could facilitate the development of effective tools for assessing nursing students' and nurses' perception of competencies required for EBP processes.","Comments":"Dolezel, Jakub Zelenikova, Renata Finotto, Stefano Mecugni, Daniela Patelarou, Athina Panczyk, Mariusz Ruzafa-Martinez, Maria Ramos-Morcillo, Antonio Jesus Skela-Savic, Brigita Gotlib, Joanna Patelarou, Evridiki Smodis, Marta Jarosova, Darja\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dolezel J ; Zelenikova R ; Finotto S ; Mecugni D ; Patelarou A ; Panczyk M ; Ruzafa-Martinez M ; Ramos-Morcillo A J; Skela-Savic B ; Gotlib J ; Patelarou E ; Smodis M ; Jarosova D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/wvn.12506","Keywords":"*Clinical Competence/st [Standards]\r\n*Nurses/px [Psychology]\r\n*Teaching/st [Standards]\r\nConsensus\r\nDelphi Technique\r\nEurope\r\nEvidence-Based Practice/mt [Methods]\r\nHumans\r\nNurses/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data]\r\nSurveys and Questionnaires\r\nTeaching/px [Psychology]","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dolezel J, Zelenikova R, Finotto S, Mecugni D, Patelarou A, Panczyk M, Ruzafa-Martinez M, Ramos-Morcillo A J, Skela-Savic B, Gotlib J, Patelarou E, Smodis M, and Jarosova D (2021) Core Evidence-Based Practice Competencies and Learning Outcomes for European Nurses: Consensus Statements.

Specifically, how EBP models and frameworks used in healthcare settings align with the original model of (1) asking the question, (2) acquiring the best evidence, (3) appraising the evidence, (4) applying the findings to clinical practice and (5) evaluating the outcomes of change, along with patient values and preferences and clinical skills. DESIGN: A Scoping review. INCLUDED SOURCES AND ARTICLES: Published articles were identified through searches within electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus) from January 1990 to April 2022. The English language EBP models and frameworks included in the review all included the five main steps of EBP. Excluded were models and frameworks focused on one domain or strategy (eg, frameworks focused on applying findings). RESULTS: Of the 20 097 articles found by our search, 19 models and frameworks met our inclusion criteria. The results showed a diverse collection of models and frameworks. Many models and frameworks were well developed and widely used, with supporting validation and updates. Some models and frameworks provided many tools and contextual instruction, while others provided only general process instruction. The models and frameworks reviewed demonstrated that the user must possess EBP expertise and knowledge for the step of assessing evidence. The models and frameworks varied greatly in the level of instruction to assess the evidence. Only seven models and frameworks integrated patient values and preferences into their processes. CONCLUSION: Many EBP models and frameworks currently exist that provide diverse instructions on the best way to use EBP. However, the inclusion of patient values and preferences needs to be better integrated into EBP models and frameworks. Also, the issues of EBP expertise and knowledge to assess evidence must be considered when choosing a model or framework.","Comments":"Dusin, Jarrod Melanson, Andrea Mische-Lawson, Lisa\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dusin J ; Melanson A ; Mische-Lawson L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-071188","Keywords":"*Clinical Competence\r\n*Evidence-Based Practice\r\nDelivery of Health Care\r\nEvidence-Based Practice/mt [Methods]\r\nHealth Facilities\r\nHumans","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dusin J, Melanson A, and Mische-Lawson L (2023) Evidence-based practice models and frameworks in the healthcare setting: a scoping review.

A search strategy was developed to identify primary studies indexed in these databases on knowledge translation that reported the implementation of knowledge brokering. Sixty-two titles related to knowledge brokering were identified from the search after the removal of duplicates, and 24 articles met the eligibility criteria following the review of the full text documents. The findings were then synthesised using a narrative approach. RESULTS: It was found that knowledge brokering has been an effective strategy for knowledge translation. CONCLUSION: Although this review shows that knowledge brokering has been an effective strategy for KT, it advocates for more empirical studies to compare the effectiveness of specific knowledge brokering approaches with others. It also calls for empirical studies to explicate the role of library and information science professionals in knowledge brokering.","Comments":"Elueze, Isioma N\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Elueze I N; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/hir.12097","Keywords":"*Bibliometrics\r\n*Cooperative Behavior\r\n*Knowledge Management\r\n*Research Support as Topic/mt [Methods]\r\nEvidence-Based Practice/mt [Methods]\r\nHumans","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Elueze I N (2015) Evaluating the effectiveness of knowledge brokering in health research: a systematised review with some bibliometric information.

An integrative review from 2008 revealed that nurses more frequently relied on information from colleagues than information from high-level sources such as systematic reviews and evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. AIMS: To describe the information sources used by registered nurses to inform their clinical practice. METHODS: An integrative review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines, based on empirical research studies published from January 2007 until June 2021. The included studies were appraised, following which the identified sources of information from quantitative studies were compiled and ranked. Finally, the qualitative text data were summarized into categories. RESULTS: Fifty-two studies from various countries were included. The majority of studies employed a quantitative design and used original instruments. Peers were ranked as the number one source of information to inform nurses' clinical practice. However, computers and reference materials are now ranked among the top four most used information sources. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: Improvement in computer and information searching skills, as well as the availability of computerized decision support tools, may contribute to nurses' frequent use of digital sources and reference material to inform clinical practice. This review shows that nurses' most frequently reported peer nurses as their source of information in clinical practice. Information sources such as computers and reference materials were ranked higher, and information from patients was ranked lower than in the 2008 review. Developing and standardizing instruments and ensuring high-quality study design is critical for further research on nurses' sources of information for clinical practice.","Comments":"Fossum, Mariann Opsal, Anne Ehrenberg, Anna\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fossum M ; Opsal A ; Ehrenberg A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/wvn.12569","Keywords":"*Evidence-Based Practice\r\n*Nurses\r\nHumans","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fossum M, Opsal A, and Ehrenberg A (2022) Nurses' sources of information to inform clinical practice: An integrative review to guide evidence-based practice.

However, a comprehensive analysis of the factors associated with the knowledge and skill EBP in nurses has not been performed to date. This is essential for facilitating the acquisition of relevant knowledge and skills to effectively implement EBP. AIMS: The aim of the study was to determine the factors related to the knowledge and skills of EBP among nurses. METHODS: We searched various literature databases up to October 25, 2021, for relevant studies that investigated the factors associated with the knowledge and skills of EBP in nurses. The authors, year of study, country, study design, study subject information, instruments used for the assessment EBP knowledge and skills, use of multivariable analysis, and factors significantly associated with the knowledge and skills of EBP among nurses were extracted from each eligible study and collated to identify commonly reported factors. RESULTS: We identified 47 eligible studies conducted in a wide range of countries. Nine articles applied multivariable analyses, and 38 articles did not perform any multivariable analyses. The factors related to the knowledge and skill levels of EBP among nurses were classified into two categories: personal and work-environment factors. In the nine articles that conducted multivariable analysis, personal factors, which included educational level, participation in EBP education, and experience conducting research, and work-environment factors, such as resources and organizational support for EBP, were related to the knowledge and skills of EBP among nurses. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: Our review highlighted educational level, participation in EBP education, experience conducting research, and resources and organizational support for EBP as important factors that are associated with the knowledge and skills of EBP in nurses worldwide. Focusing on these factors may help improve nurses' understanding of EBP and facilitate the implementation of EBP.","Comments":"Furuki, Hideaki Sonoda, Nao Morimoto, Akiko\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Furuki H ; Sonoda N ; Morimoto A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/wvn.12623","Keywords":"*Delivery of Health Care\r\n*Evidence-Based Practice\r\nAttitude of Health Personnel\r\nContinuing\r\nEducation\r\nEducational Status\r\nEvidence-Based Nursing\r\nHumans\r\nNursing\r\nSurveys and Questionnaires","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Furuki H, Sonoda N, and Morimoto A (2023) Factors related to the knowledge and skills of evidence-based practice among nurses worldwide: A scoping review.

METHODS: A scoping review was undertaken. Three electronic databases (CINAHL, PubMed and Cochrane) were searched in January 2022. The search phrases consisted of the following terms: healthcare professionals, EBP, competence and instrument and their synonyms, keywords and MeSH terms. The database search was run without any limitations. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed to support reporting. RESULTS: Ultimately, 39 studies were included; most of them (35) were cross-sectional studies. The studies were conducted in 17 countries. A total of 17 evidence-based knowledge and skills instruments were identified. The Upton and Upton instrument was used in 19 studies. Twelve self-reported instruments were used only once. The psychometric properties of the instruments varied. The reliability was typically reported with Cronbach's alpha coefficient. The content of the EBP knowledge/skills instruments consists of five main categories: EBP, evaluation of current practice, preparation for the implementation of EBP, implementation of evidence and active participation in the development of EBP. CONCLUSION: Almost all instruments are self-assessment instruments. Validated knowledge tests should be further developed. The instruments emphasise the preparation for the implementation of EBP. Further research is needed to develop instruments for healthcare professionals to assess the knowledge and skills of the implementation of evidence.","Comments":"Haavisto, Elina Siltanen, Hannele Tolvanen, Anna Holopainen, Arja\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Haavisto E ; Siltanen H ; Tolvanen A ; Holopainen A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.16506","Keywords":"*Clinical Competence\r\n*Health Personnel\r\nDelivery of Health Care\r\nEvidence-Based Practice\r\nHumans\r\nPsychometrics\r\nReproducibility of Results","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Haavisto E, Siltanen H, Tolvanen A, and Holopainen A (2023) Instruments for assessing healthcare professionals' knowledge and skills of evidence-based practice: A scoping review.

BACKGROUND: Previous systematic reviews have focused on the items used in reporting educational interventions for facilitating evidence-based practices in medicine and health care or teaching research literacy in nursing as well as on the outcomes of these interventions. DESIGN: A systematic review based on a procedure of the Centre for Reviews and Disseminations for conducting a systematic review of health interventions. DATA SOURCES AND METHODS: Texts from 2008 to 2015 were sought from the Cochrane, CINAHL and PubMed Medline databases. Eight studies were selected for the final data and reviewed for quality. Data were analysed with narrative synthesis including qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Four main categories and sixteen subcategories were identified. The learning contents included principles of EBN and research, the process of EBN, and planning a change in practice. The most popular teaching/learning methods were lectures/didactic presentations and group work. The interventions encouraged learners to critically examine and evaluate their practice. The interventions also improved participants' capacity to identify the need for research evidence in clinical practice. CONCLUSION: The educational interventions were fairly similar and had promising results. However, as the level of evidence was modest in the studies, there are several development needs for interventions and further research challenges. Interventions should provide participants with sufficient competences for implementing every step of EBN, with special focus on the implementation of evidence in patient care. The assessment of the outcomes of interventions should cover all learning categories of EBN with focus on medium to long-term effectiveness. The influence of different teaching/learning methods and learning contexts and settings should be investigated further.","Comments":"Haggman-Laitila, Arja Mattila, Lea-Riitta Melender, Hanna-Leena S0260-6917(16)30048-X\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Haggman-Laitila A ; Mattila L R; Melender H L; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2016.04.023","Keywords":"*Clinical Competence/st [Standards]\r\n*Evidence-Based Nursing/mt [Methods]\r\n*Teaching/st [Standards]\r\nHumans\r\nLearning","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Haggman-Laitila A, Mattila L R, and Melender H L (2016) Educational interventions on evidence-based nursing in clinical practice: A systematic review with qualitative analysis.

METHODS: We performed a systematic search and review of the medical literature on PubMed, Embase, ERIC, Scopus and Web of Science from the earliest available date until September 4, 2019. RESULTS: We screened 9,042 references and included 29 full-text studies and 14 meeting abstracts. Eighteen studies had moderate validity, and 6 had high validity. The EBM curricular structure proved highly variable in between studies. The majority of the EBM curricula was longitudinal with different lengths. Only five studies reported using Kern's six-step approach for curriculum development. Twenty-one articles reported on EBM skills and knowledge, and only 5/29 full-text articles used a validated assessment tool. Time was the main barrier to EBM curriculum implementation. All the included studies and abstracts, independent of the EBM curriculum structure or evaluation method used, found an improvement in the residents' attitudes and/or EBM skills and knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: The current body of literature available to guide educators in EBM curriculum development is enough to constitute a strong scaffold for developing any EBM curriculum. Given the amount of time and resources needed to develop and implement an EBM curriculum, it is very important to follow the curriculum development steps and use validated assessment tools.","Comments":"Halalau, Alexandra Holmes, Brett Rogers-Snyr, Andrea Donisan, Teodora Nielsen, Eric Cerqueira, Tiago Lemos Guyatt, Gordon ijme.12.101124\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Halalau A ; Holmes B ; Rogers-Snyr A ; Donisan T ; Nielsen E ; Cerqueira T L; Guyatt G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.5116/ijme.6097.ccc0","Keywords":"*Internship and Residency\r\n*Physicians\r\nAttitude\r\nCurriculum\r\nEvidence-Based Medicine/ed [Education]\r\nHumans","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Halalau A, Holmes B, Rogers-Snyr A, Donisan T, Nielsen E, Cerqueira T L, and Guyatt G (2021) Evidence-based medicine curricula and barriers for physicians in training: a scoping review.

For reason that it has a critical impact on organization performance. The purpose of this study was to identify factors affecting EBMgt among managers. METHODS: The following electronic databases were used: PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, ProQuest, Embase and Scopus. In addition, we searched Google Scholar, Emerald, Academy of Management (AOM), and the website for the Center for Evidence-Based Management (CEBMa) for articles related to EBMgt. We used data sources published up to September 2017, without language restriction. We appraised the methodological quality of studies using the checklists of SRQR and MMAT. The synthesis involved interpretative analysis based on the principles of meta-synthesis. RESULTS: Of 26,011 identified studies, 26 met the full inclusion criteria. Of the 26 studies assessed, the frequency of qualitative studies and mixed-methods were 20 and 6, respectively, and the quality of 3 studies was weak. A total of 23 studies from 7 countries were included: Canada (n=8), USA (n=6), Australia (n=4), UK (n=3), Iran (n=1, Brazil (n=1); none were from Africa. Meta-synthesis findings of 23 studies identified four main factors: facilitators (5 main themes), barriers (5 main themes), sources of evidence (4 main themes), and the process of decision making in EBMgt (1 main theme). CONCLUSIONS: EBMgt is crucial to improve the quality of management decisions, and hence, to improve service delivery, effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, to increase the benefit and utilization of EBMgt, training organizations and research institutes must more actively involve managers in setting research plans.","Comments":"Hasanpoor, Edris Hajebrahimi, Sakineh Janati, Ali Abedini, Zahra Haghgoshayie, Elaheh\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hasanpoor E ; Hajebrahimi S ; Janati A ; Abedini Z ; Haghgoshayie E ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.4314/ejhs.v28i5.18","Keywords":"*Decision Making\r\n*Delivery of Health Care/st [Standards]\r\n*Evidence-Based Practice\r\n*Health Personnel\r\nHumans\r\nQualitative Research","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hasanpoor E, Hajebrahimi S, Janati A, Abedini Z, and Haghgoshayie E (2018) Barriers, Facilitators, Process and Sources of Evidence for Evidence-Based Management among Health Care Managers: A Qualitative Systematic Review.

Nurses themselves identify poor experiences with trying to understand and use research as factors that contribute to a reluctance to utilize research. This reluctance often leads nurses to seek other sources of information, such as colleagues, instead. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to identify the effectiveness of research literacy interventions on the research literacy of registered nurses. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Registered nurses. Interventions of interest were those that evaluated the effectiveness of workplace educational programs or interventions conducted in a healthcare organization or tertiary-level educational facility aiming to improve or increase registered nurses' understanding of research literature.Outcomes of interest were research literacy, measured explicitly or as research knowledge, research understanding, use of research evidence in practice, and/or ability to critically appraise research. We considered experimental study designs such as randomized controlled trials, nonrandomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental, and before and after studies. SEARCH STRATEGY: A wide range of databases were searched in order to provide the most complete possible review of the evidence. Initial keywords used were: \"research litera*\", \"research education\", \"research knowledge\", \"evidence-based practice education\". METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Papers selected for retrieval were assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using standardized critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI). DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted from papers included in the review using the standardized data extraction tool from JBI-MAStARI. DATA SYNTHESIS: Quantitative data would have been, if possible, pooled in statistical meta-analysis using the Cochrane Collaboration's Review Manager 5.2 software. As statistical pooling was not possible, the findings are presented in narrative form including tables and figures where appropriate to aid in data presentation. RESULTS: The majority of included studies were single-group pre-test/post-test designs (n=7). One was a post-test only two-group comparison and two were two-group quasi-experimental studies. Included studies were conducted in Taiwan, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, United Kingdom and United States. The total number of registered nurses in the included studies was 453. The educational interventions were conducted in universities (n=6) and healthcare facilities (n=4). Most included studies were published (n=9), with one unpublished study. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence on educational interventions, while not strong, is indicative of the types of interventions which are likely to be effective. Online or face-to-face interventions using interactive teaching strategies, such as activities, role-play and discussions, and which are underpinned by an appropriate behavioral or education theory, are likely to increase research literacy. Implications for practice: IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: More rigorous experimental studies of educational interventions for nurses' research literacy are warranted, in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of different course and program designs. Future studies should consider longer periods of follow-up to test the longevity of the effect, as education needs to have lasting effects to be beneficial to the recipients.","Comments":"Hines, Sonia Ramsbotham, Joanne Coyer, Fiona\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hines S ; Ramsbotham J ; Coyer F ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.11124/jbisrir-2016-2378","Keywords":"*Education\r\n*Knowledge\r\n*Literacy/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data]\r\n*Nurses/px [Psychology]\r\n*Research/ed [Education]\r\nAdult\r\nAustralia\r\nDelivery of Health Care/st [Standards]\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInformation Literacy\r\nLiteracy/td [Trends]\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNon-Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nNursing/mt [Methods]\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nUnited States","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hines S, Ramsbotham J, and Coyer F (2016) Interventions for improving the research literacy of nurses: a systematic review.

This struggle becomes a barrier to engaging in evidence-based practice (EBP). Personal beliefs, attitudes about research, and difficulties with research language and statistics have been reported as important variables in quantitative studies. AIMS: The aim of this review was to explore nurses' experiences and perceptions of interacting with research literature for work or educational purposes. METHODS: Studies eligible for inclusion were qualitative, published in English from years 2009-2020, and included registered nurses engaged in interaction with research literature for any work or educational purpose. The Joanna Briggs Institute's qualitative systematic review methods were used. RESULTS: We included 11 qualitative studies with 186 participants. Most studies used focus groups or semi-structured interviews to collect data. Overall, study quality was moderate. We extracted 29 findings, which were synthesized into five categories, and meta-aggregated into one synthesis. Research is a complex field of engagement for nurses, who simultaneously value its contribution to their profession and feel the burden of unsupported expectations. Nurses perceive a double standard in their workplaces where expectations of using evidence in practice are often discussed, but EBP education and access to literature can be hard to access. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: Educators conducting research education should consider the complex emotional reactions this activity may engender in participants who may feel unprepared by their previous experience or education. Clinicians and workplace leaders trying to encourage the use of evidence in practice should consider the source of any reluctance to engage. An observed lack of engagement in their staff may be related to issues with understanding the materials.","Comments":"Hines, Sonia RN Ramsbotham, Joanne RN Coyer, Fiona RN\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hines S Rn; Ramsbotham J Rn; Coyer F Rn; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/wvn.12542","Keywords":"*Evidence-Based Practice\r\nHumans\r\nQualitative Research","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hines S Rn, Ramsbotham J Rn, and Coyer F Rn (2021) The Experiences and Perceptions of Nurses Interacting With Research Literature: A Qualitative Systematic Review to Guide Evidence-Based Practice.

The objective of this study was to identify potential barriers and facilitators experienced by managers to the use of evidence in program management within health care organizations. METHODS: The authors conducted a comprehensive search for published, peer-reviewed and grey literature that explores the use of evidence in program management. Two reviewers selected relevant studies from which data was extracted using a standard data abstraction form and tabulated for qualitative analysis. The results were summarized through narrative review. The quality of the included studies was assessed using published criteria for the critical appraisal of qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods research. RESULTS: Fourteen papers were included in the review. Barriers and facilitators were categorized into five main thematic areas: (1) Information, (2) Organization--Structure and Process, (3) Organization--Culture, (4) Individual, and (5) Interaction. CONCLUSION: This paper reviews the literature on barriers and facilitators to evidence-informed decision-making experienced by program management decision-makers within health care organizations. The multidimensional solutions required to promote evidence-informed program management can be developed through an understanding of the existing barriers and facilitators of evidence-use.","Comments":"Humphries, Serena Stafinski, Tania Mumtaz, Zubia Menon, Devidas\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Humphries S ; Stafinski T ; Mumtaz Z ; Menon D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-14-171","Keywords":"*Decision Making\r\n*Evidence-Based Practice\r\n*Guideline Adherence\r\n*Health Facility Administration\r\nOrganizational","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Humphries S, Stafinski T, Mumtaz Z, and Menon D (2014) Barriers and facilitators to evidence-use in program management: a systematic review of the literature.

Nurses are required to have dynamic capabilities that adjust to changes. However, there is no clear concept of dynamic capabilities in the field of evidence-based practice. The concept of dynamic capabilities needs to be derived from the management field and defined in evidence-based practice. METHODS: A Boolean search of the Web of Science, ProQuest, CINAHL, PubMed, and Emerald databases was conducted, and 35 articles met the inclusion criteria. The concept derivation and analysis strategy of Walker and Avant was used to form and define the concept of evidence-based practice dynamic capabilities. This method includes: selecting a concept, determining the aims of the analysis, identifying usages of the concept, determining the defining attributes, identifying antecedents, consequences, and allied concepts. RESULTS: Sensing capability, learning capability, integration capability, and coordination capability are attributes of the concept. The antecedents include personal and infrastructure related factors. The consequences include improved patient outcomes, reduced medical costs, and increased nurse job satisfaction. The allied concept is evidence-based practice competence. CONCLUSIONS: An operational definition of the concept was developed. The concept compensates for the shortcomings of the existing \"evidence-based practice competence\" concept and helps nursing managers establish a new perspective on the effective implementation of evidence-based practice.","Comments":"Huo, Miao Zhao, Bolun Li, Ye Li, Jinghua\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Huo M ; Zhao B ; Li Y ; Li J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-21-6506","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Huo M, Zhao B, Li Y, and Li J (2022) Evidence-based practice dynamic capabilities: a concept derivation and analysis.

Despite the mantra of EBM encouraging the use of evidence to inform practice, there appears little evidence available on how best to teach EBM to medical trainees. A systematic review was performed to identify what type of educational method is most effective at increasing medical trainees' competency in EBM. METHODS: A systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was performed. Electronic searches were performed across three databases. Two reviewers independently searched, extracted and reviewed the articles. The quality of each study was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias assessment tool. RESULTS: In total, 177 citations were returned, from which 14 studies were RCTs and examined for full text. Nine of the studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Learner competency in EBM increased post-intervention across all studies. However, no difference in learner outcomes was identified across a variety of educational modes, including lecture versus online, direct versus self-directed, multidisciplinary versus discipline-specific groups, lecture versus active small group facilitated learning. CONCLUSIONS: The body of evidence available to guide educators on how to teach EBM to medical trainees is small, albeit of a good quality. The major limitation in assessing risk of bias was the inability to blind participants to an educational intervention and lack of clarity regarding certain aspects within studies. Further evidence, and transparency in design, is required to guide the development and implementation of educational strategies in EBM, including modes of teaching and the timing of delivering EBM content within the broader medical curriculum. Further research is required to determine the effects of timing, content and length of EBM courses and teaching methods.","Comments":"Ilic, Dragan Maloney, Stephen Comment in (CIN)\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ilic D ; Maloney S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/medu.12288","Keywords":"*Clinical Competence\r\n*Education\r\n*Evidence-Based Medicine/ed [Education]\r\n*Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nAttitudes\r\nBias\r\nBibliographic\r\nDatabases\r\nEvidence-Based Medicine/mt [Methods]\r\nHealth Knowledge\r\nHumans\r\nMedical/mt [Methods]\r\nPractice","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ilic D, and Maloney S (2014) Methods of teaching medical trainees evidence-based medicine: a systematic review.

They are an established part of the medical education system and are considered to be a practical way to improve the content knowledge of health professionals. AIMS: To determine the effectiveness of journal clubs for increasing health professionals' competency in EBM. METHODS: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was performed. Electronic searches were conducted in October 2019 across MEDLINE, ERIC and Scopus databases. Two authors independently reviewed articles, and extracted data. A risk-of-bias tool, based on the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias in RCTs, was used to assess internal validity. RESULTS: A total of 151 citations were returned, from which five studies (n = 378 individuals) were included in the final review. No overall statistical difference in knowledge scores was observed between health professionals participating in journal clubs compared to other professional education modes (SMD 0.15, 95% CI -0.09, 0.39). Similarly, no significant difference in attitudes or implementation of evidence-based medicine practices was observed across studies. CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to support the effectiveness of journal clubs in improving the knowledge, attitudes, and implementation of evidence-based skills by health professionals in clinical practice.

METHODS: A scoping literature review was done to answer the question: What is known from the existing empirical literature about factors, context, and processes that influence the uptake, implementation, and sustainability of evidence-based practice in healthcare organizations? This review used the Arksey and O'Malley framework to describe findings and to identify gaps in the existing research literature. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were developed to screen studies. Relevant studies published between January 1991 and March 2014 were identified using four electronic databases. Study abstracts were screened for eligibility by two reviewers. Following this screening process, full-text articles were reviewed to determine the eligibility of the studies by the primary author. Eligible studies were then analyzed by coding findings with descriptive labels to distinguish elements that appeared relevant to this literature review. Coding was used to form categories, and these categories led to the development of themes. RESULTS: Thirty studies met the eligibility criteria for this literature review. The themes identified were: the process organizations use to select evidence-based practices for adoption, use of a needs assessment, linkage to the organization's strategic direction, organizational culture, the organization's internal social networks, resources (including education and training, presence of information technology, financial resources, resources for patient care, and staff qualifications), leadership, the presence of champions, standardization of processes, role clarity of staff, and the presence of social capital. CONCLUSION: Several gaps were identified by this review. There is a lack of research on how evidence-based practices may be sustained by organizations. Most of the research done to date has been cross-sectional. Longitudinal research would give insight into the relationship between organizational characteristics and the uptake, implementation, and sustainability of evidence-based practice. In addition, although it is clear that financial resources are required to implement evidence-based practice, existing studies contain a lack of detail about the cost of adopting and using new practices. This scoping review contains a number of implications for healthcare administrators, managers, and providers to consider when adopting and implementing evidence-based practices in healthcare organizations.","Comments":"Innis, Jennifer Dryden-Palmer, Karen Perreira, Tyrone Berta, Whitney\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Innis J ; Dryden-Palmer K ; Perreira T ; Berta W ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1097/xeb.0000000000000049","Keywords":"*Diffusion of Innovation\r\n*Evidence-Based Practice\r\n*Health Facility Administration","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Innis J, Dryden-Palmer K, Perreira T, and Berta W (2015) How do health care organizations take on best practices?

BACKGROUND: How health-care organisations adopt and implement innovations such as new evidence-based practices will depend on their absorptive, or learning, capacity. Absorptive capacity manifests as routines, which are the practices, procedures and customs that organisational members use to carry out work and to make work-related decisions. METHODS: Using the construct of absorptive capacity as well as a recent literature review of how health-care organisations take on best practices, we illustrate how the uptake and use of new knowledge, such as evidence-based practices, can be facilitated through the use of routines. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: This paper highlights routines that nurse managers can use to foster environments where evidence-based practices can be readily identified, and strategies for facilitating their adoption and implementation. CONCLUSIONS: The construct of absorptive capacity and the use of routines can be used to examine the ways in which nurse managers can adopt, implement and evaluate the use of evidence-based practices.","Comments":"Innis, Jennifer Berta, Whitney\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Innis J ; Berta W ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.12368","Keywords":"*Evidence-Based Practice/mt [Methods]\r\n*Nurse Administrators/st [Standards]\r\n*Organizational Innovation\r\n*Program Development/mt [Methods]\r\nDelivery of Health Care/mt [Methods]\r\nHumans\r\nNurse Administrators/td [Trends]\r\nOrganizational Culture\r\nWorkforce","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Innis J, and Berta W (2016) Routines for change: how managers can use absorptive capacity to adopt and implement evidence-based practice.

This gap is primarily due to identified barriers in utilizing the research findings in actual nursing practice. Objective: To present a scientific mapping of the Scopus-indexed literature published from 2002 to 2021, which studied barriers to research utilization in nursing using the BARRIER scale. Methods: This systematic review utilized bibliometric analysis. One hundred seventy-nine extracted literature from Scopus was manually reviewed, and the study included 53 documents for further analysis. Results: Remarkably, almost three-fourths of the documents identified setting-related factors as the most common barrier to research utilization in nursing (n = 39, 73.58%). This is followed by presentation-related factors (n = 16.98%) and nurse-related factors (n = 5, 9.43%), respectively. Findings revealed that insufficient time at work in implementing new ideas was perceived as the top barrier in research utilization in nursing. Conclusion: It is crucial to determine the hindrances to the utilization of research findings. The results of this study establish the connection between research and evidence-based practice which stimulates in meeting the gap in the current nursing practice. Future studies must include research utilization studies that apply tools other than the BARRIER scale.","Comments":"Jabonete, Fritz Gerald V Roxas, Rachel Edita O\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jabonete F G.

The main objective of this scoping review was to identify and synthesize all research studies on journal or book clubs for pharmacy learners. A secondary objective was to identify gaps in the literature where future research would be beneficial to pharmacy educators and learners. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was run across five databases. Studies were screened using a two stage, blinded, independent screening process. RESULTS: Forty-two studies met all inclusion criteria; 86% reported on journal clubs and 14% on book clubs. Of the journal club studies, 50% were in didactic courses, 33% in experiential education, and 17% were co-curricular initiatives. Of the six book club studies, 67% were within didactic courses and 33% were co-curricular initiatives, including the only interprofessional education study. Most journal clubs were used to teach evidence-based practice, drug literature evaluation, or biostatistics. Book clubs were more focused on soft skills or topics students were less likely to encounter in the core curriculum. IMPLICATIONS: Future research on journal clubs and book clubs in pharmacy education should continue to assess student learning outcomes and abilities. Specifically, future studies should move beyond evaluating student perceptions of journal clubs to investigate effectiveness for topics other than drug literature evaluation or evidence-based practice, and the impact of journal clubs and book clubs on interprofessional knowledge, communication, and team dynamics.","Comments":"Jones, Emily P Nelson, Nicholas R Thorpe, Carolyn T Rodgers, Philip T Carlson, Rebecca B S1877-1297(21)00353-1","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jones E P; Nelson N R; Thorpe C T; Rodgers P T; Carlson R B; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cptl.2021.11.029","Keywords":"Curriculum\r\n*Education, Pharmacy\r\nHumans\r\n*Pharmacy\r\nProblem-Based Learning\r\n*Students, Pharmacy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jones E P, Nelson N R, Thorpe C T, Rodgers P T, and Carlson R B (2022) Use of journal clubs and book clubs in pharmacy education: A scoping review.

The aim of this systematic review was to describe educational interventions promoting EBP and their outcomes among emergency nurses, compared with no education, to inform clinicians and researchers about effective educational interventions suitable for use in emergency departments (EDs). METHODS: CINAHL, Cochrane, PubMed and Scopus were systematically searched to identify studies published between January 1, 2006 and October 20, 2016 describing educational interventions designed to promote EBP among emergency nurses. 711 studies were identified and screened; 10 were selected for inclusion and quality assessment. The studies were analyzed using deductive content analysis, and the review's results are presented in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS: Ten relevant studies on nine different self-developed educational interventions were identified. Eight studies had highly significant or significant results. Interventions involving face-to-face contact led to significant or highly significant effects on patient benefits and emergency nurses' knowledge, skills, and behavior. Interventions using written self-directed learning material led to significant improvements in nurses' knowledge of EBP. All the descriptions of the interventions were incomplete, and the reported details varied considerably between the studies. CONCLUSIONS: There have been few studies on educational interventions to promote EBP among emergency nurses but the available results are promising.","Comments":"Koota, Elina Kaariainen, Maria Melender, Hanna-Leena S1755-599X(18)30088-0\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Koota E ; Kaariainen M ; Melender H L; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ienj.2018.06.004","Keywords":"*Emergency Nursing/ed [Education]\r\n*Evidence-Based Practice/ed [Education]\r\n*Teaching/st [Standards]\r\nBiomedical/mt [Methods]\r\nBiomedical/st [Standards]\r\nEvidence-Based Practice/mt [Methods]\r\nHumans\r\nTranslational Research","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Koota E, Kaariainen M, and Melender H L (2018) Educational interventions promoting evidence-based practice among emergency nurses: A systematic review.

Alongside this growth is a need to evaluate the effectiveness of EBM curriculum as assessed by competency in the five 'A's': asking, acquiring, appraising, applying and assessing (impact and performance). EBM educators in medical education will benefit from a compendium of existing assessment tools for assessing EBM competencies in their settings. The purpose of this review is to provide a systematic review and taxonomy of validated tools that evaluate EBM teaching in medical education. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane library, Educational Resources Information Centre (ERIC), Best Evidence Medical Education (BEME) databases and references of retrieved articles published between January 2005 and March 2019. We have presented the identified tools along with their psychometric properties including validity, reliability and relevance to the five domains of EBM practice and dimensions of EBM learning. We also assessed the quality of the tools to identify high quality tools as those supported by established interrater reliability (if applicable), objective (non-self-reported) outcome measures and achieved >= 3 types of established validity evidence. We have reported our study in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS: We identified 1719 potentially relevant articles of which 63 full text articles were assessed for eligibility against inclusion and exclusion criteria. Twelve articles each with a unique and newly identified tool were included in the final analysis. Of the twelve tools, all of them assessed the third step of EBM practice (appraise) and four assessed just that one step. None of the twelve tools assessed the last step of EBM practice (assess). Of the seven domains of EBM learning, ten tools assessed knowledge gain, nine assessed skills and-one assessed attitude. None addressed reaction to EBM teaching, self-efficacy, behaviours or patient benefit. Of the twelve tools identified, six were high quality. We have also provided a taxonomy of tools using the CREATE framework, for EBM teachers in medical education. CONCLUSIONS: Six tools of reasonable validity are available for evaluating most steps of EBM and some domains of EBM learning.

Implementing EBP in clinical practice is a complex process that can be challenging and slow. Lack of EBP knowledge, skills, attitudes, self-efficacy, and behavior can be essential barriers that should be measured using valid and reliable instruments for the population in question. Results from previous systematic reviews show that information regarding high-quality instruments that measure EBP attitudes, behavior, and self-efficacy in various healthcare disciplines need to be improved. This systematic review aimed to summarize the measurement properties of existing instruments that measure healthcare professionals' EBP attitudes, behaviors, and self-efficacy. METHODS: We included studies that reported measurement properties of instruments that measure healthcare professionals' EBP attitudes, behaviors, and self-efficacy. Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, HaPI, AMED via Ovid, and Cinahl via Ebscohost were searched in October 2020. The search was updated in December 2022. The measurement properties extracted included data on the item development process, content validity, structural validity, internal consistency, reliability, and measurement error. The quality assessment, rating of measurement properties, synthesis, and modified grading of the evidence were conducted in accordance with the COSMIN methodology for systematic reviews. RESULTS: Thirty-four instruments that measure healthcare professionals' EBP attitudes, behaviors or self-efficacy were identified. Seventeen of the 34 were validated in two or more healthcare disciplines. Nurses were most frequently represented (n = 53). Despite the varying quality of instrument development and content validity studies, most instruments received sufficient ( +) ratings on content validity, with the quality of evidence graded as \"very low\" in most cases. Structural validity and internal consistency were the measurement properties most often assessed, and reliability and measurement error were most rarely assessed. The quality assessment results and overall rating of these measurement properties varied, but the quality of evidence was generally graded higher for these properties than for content validity. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the summarized results, the constructs, and the population of interest, several instruments can be recommended for use in various healthcare disciplines. However, future studies should strive to use qualitative methods to further develop existing EBP instruments and involve the target population.

METHODS: A scoping review following the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidance was conducted with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) used to guide reporting. RESULTS: The narrative overview of 23 studies provides insight into the 'what' and 'how' of teaching SDM within the context of EBP education. A minority of studies explicitly and concurrently incorporated EBP and SDM in terms of how programme content was organised. Teaching strategies most often used regardless of learner cohort or setting included didactic, face-to-face lectures, together with role-play/modelling, small group workshops and video recordings. Programme evaluation outcomes predominantly focused on participant reactions to training and participant learning. CONCLUSION: While a disconnect between EBP and SDM remains evident in healthcare programmes, increased recognition by educators to actively facilitate this interdependent relationship is emerging. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Intentionally structuring learning activities in a manner which demonstrates the relevance and interdependence of SDM and EBP may mitigate 'learning silos' and enhance learners' abilities to make connections required in practice.","Comments":"Lehane, Elaine Curtin, Catriona Corrigan, Mark S0738-3991(23)00010-1\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lehane E ; Curtin C ; Corrigan M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2023.107630","Keywords":"*Decision Making\r\n*Delivery of Health Care\r\nEducational Status\r\nEvidence-Based Practice\r\nHumans\r\nLearning\r\nShared","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lehane E, Curtin C, and Corrigan M (2023) Teaching strategies for shared decision-making within the context of evidence-based healthcare practice: A scoping review.

BACKGROUND: Evidence-based practice has been proposed for optimal patient care for more than three decades, yet competence in evidence-based practice knowledge and skills among nurse clinicians remains difficult to measure. There is a need to identify well-validated and reliable instruments for assessing competence for evidence-based practice in nursing. DESIGN: Psychometric systematic review. DATA SOURCES: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, ERIC, CDSR, All EBM reviews and PsycInfo databases were searched from 1960-April 2013; with no language restrictions applied. REVIEW METHODS: Using pre-determined inclusion criteria, three reviewers independently identified studies for full-text review, extracting data and grading instrument validity using a Psychometric Grading Framework. RESULTS: Of 91 studies identified for full-text review, 59 met the inclusion criteria representing 24 different instruments. The Psychometric Grading Framework determined that only two instruments had adequate validity - the Evidence Based Practice Questionnaire measuring knowledge, skills and attitudes and another un-named instrument measuring only EBP knowledge and attitudes. Instruments used in another nine studies were graded as having 'weak' validity and instruments in the remaining 24 studies were graded as 'very weak'. CONCLUSION: The Evidence Based Practice Questionnaire was assessed as having the highest validity and was the most practical instrument to use. However, the Evidence Based Practice Questionnaire relies totally on self-report rather than direct measurement of competence suggesting a need for a performance-based instrument for measuring evidence-based knowledge, skills and attitudes in nursing.","Comments":"Leung, Kat Trevena, Lyndal Waters, Donna\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Leung K ; Trevena L ; Waters D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.12454","Keywords":"*Evidence-Based Practice\r\n*Health Knowledge\r\n*Nursing Staff/px [Psychology]\r\nAttitudes\r\nHumans\r\nPractice\r\nPsychometrics","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Leung K, Trevena L, and Waters D (2014) Systematic review of instruments for measuring nurses' knowledge, skills and attitudes for evidence-based practice.

However, implementation scientists have not reached consensus on which features are most important for implementing evidence-based practices. The aims of this review were to identify the most commonly reported organizational contextual features that influence the implementation of evidence-based practices across healthcare settings, and to describe how these features affect implementation. METHODS: An integrative review was undertaken following literature searches in CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases from January 2005 to June 2017. English language, peer-reviewed empirical studies exploring organizational context in at least one implementation initiative within a healthcare setting were included. Quality appraisal of the included studies was performed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Inductive content analysis informed data extraction and reduction. RESULTS: The search generated 5152 citations. After removing duplicates and applying eligibility criteria, 36 journal articles were included. The majority (n = 20) of the study designs were qualitative, 11 were quantitative, and 5 used a mixed methods approach. Six main organizational contextual features (organizational culture; leadership; networks and communication; resources; evaluation, monitoring and feedback; and champions) were most commonly reported to influence implementation outcomes in the selected studies across a wide range of healthcare settings. CONCLUSIONS: We identified six organizational contextual features that appear to be interrelated and work synergistically to influence the implementation of evidence-based practices within an organization. Organizational contextual features did not influence implementation efforts independently from other features. Rather, features were interrelated and often influenced each other in complex, dynamic ways to effect change. These features corresponded to the constructs in the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), which supports the use of CFIR as a guiding framework for studies that explore the relationship between organizational context and implementation. Organizational culture was most commonly reported to affect implementation. Leadership exerted influence on the five other features, indicating it may be a moderator or mediator that enhances or impedes the implementation of evidence-based practices. Future research should focus on how organizational features interact to influence implementation effectiveness.","Comments":"Li, Shelly-Anne Jeffs, Lianne Barwick, Melanie Stevens, Bonnie\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Li S A; Jeffs L ; Barwick M ; Stevens B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-018-0734-5","Keywords":"*Delivery of Health Care/og [Organization & Administration]\r\n*Evidence-Based Practice\r\n*Health Plan Implementation/mt [Methods]\r\n*Leadership\r\n*Organizational Culture\r\nBiomedical\r\nHumans\r\nTranslational Research","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Li S A, Jeffs L, Barwick M, and Stevens B (2018) Organizational contextual features that influence the implementation of evidence-based practices across healthcare settings: a systematic integrative review.

Despite this use in clinical practice, their impact on patient care and learning outcomes is incompletely understood. A comprehensive synthesis of available evidence regarding the effectiveness of electronic knowledge resources would guide clinicians, health care system administrators, medical educators, and informaticians in making evidence-based decisions about their purchase, implementation, and use. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review is to quantify the impact of electronic knowledge resources on clinical and learning outcomes. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library for articles published from 1991 to 2017. Two authors independently screened studies for inclusion and extracted outcomes related to knowledge, skills, attitudes, behaviors, patient effects, and cost. We used random-effects meta-analysis to pool standardized mean differences (SMDs) across studies. RESULTS: Of 10,811 studies screened, we identified 25 eligible studies published between 2003 and 2016. A total of 5 studies were randomized trials, 22 involved physicians in practice or training, and 10 reported potential conflicts of interest. A total of 15 studies compared electronic knowledge resources with no intervention. Of these, 7 reported clinician behaviors, with a pooled SMD of 0.47 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.67; P<.001), and 8 reported objective patient effects with a pooled SMD of 0.19 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.32; P=.003). Heterogeneity was large (I<sup>2</sup>>50%) across studies. When compared with other resources-7 studies, not amenable to meta-analytic pooling-the use of electronic knowledge resources was associated with increased frequency of answering questions and perceived benefits on patient care, with variable impact on time to find an answer. A total of 2 studies compared different implementations of the same electronic knowledge resource. CONCLUSIONS: Use of electronic knowledge resources is associated with a positive impact on clinician behaviors and patient effects. We found statistically significant associations between the use of electronic knowledge resources and improved clinician behaviors and patient effects. When compared with other resources, the use of electronic knowledge resources was associated with increased success in answering clinical questions, with variable impact on speed. Comparisons of different implementation strategies of the same electronic knowledge resource suggest that there are benefits from allowing clinicians to choose to access the resource, versus automated display of resource information, and from integrating patient-specific information. A total of 4 studies compared different commercial electronic knowledge resources, with variable results. Resource implementation strategies can significantly influence outcomes but few studies have examined such factors.","Comments":"Maggio, Lauren A Aakre, Christopher A Del Fiol, Guilherme Shellum, Jane Cook, David A\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Maggio L A; Aakre C A; Del Fiol G ; Shellum J ; Cook D A; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.2196/13315","Keywords":"*Decision Support Systems\r\n*Education\r\n*Health Resources/st [Standards]\r\n*Learning\r\nClinical/st [Standards]\r\nHumans\r\nMedical/st [Standards]\r\nTelemedicine","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Maggio L A, Aakre C A, Del Fiol G, Shellum J, and Cook D A (2019) Impact of Clinicians' Use of Electronic Knowledge Resources on Clinical and Learning Outcomes: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

Recommendations have been made that capacity building efforts be established to support individuals to enact KT. In this study, we summarized existing knowledge on KT competencies to provide a foundation for such capacity building efforts and to inform policy and research. Our research questions were \"What are the core KT competencies needed in the health sector?\" and \"What are the interventions and strategies to teach and reinforce those competencies?\" METHODS: We used a scoping review approach and an integrated KT process by involving an Advisory Group of diverse stakeholders. We searched seven health and interdisciplinary electronic databases and grey literature sources for materials published from 2003 to 2017 in English language only. Empirical and theoretical publications in health that examined KT competencies were retrieved, reviewed, and synthesized. RESULTS: Overall, 1171 publications were retrieved; 137 were fully reviewed; and 15 empirical and six conceptual academic, and 52 grey literature publications were included and synthesized in this scoping review. From both the academic and grey literature, we categorized 19 KT core competencies into knowledge, skills, or attitudes; and identified commonly used interventions and strategies to enhance KT competencies such as education, organizational support and hands-on training. CONCLUSIONS: These initial core KT competencies for individuals provide implications for education, policy, knowledge brokering, and future research, and on the need for future evaluation of the KT competencies presented. We also discuss the essential role of organizational support and culture for successful KT activities/practice.","Comments":"Mallidou, Anastasia A Atherton, Pat Chan, Liza Frisch, Noreen Glegg, Stephanie Scarrow, Gayle\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mallidou A A; Atherton P ; Chan L ; Frisch N ; Glegg S ; Scarrow G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-018-3314-4","Keywords":"*Clinical Competence\r\n*Translational Research\r\nBiomedical\r\nBiomedical/og [Organization & Administration]\r\nCapacity Building\r\nEvidence-Based Practice\r\nHumans\r\nTranslational Research","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mallidou A A, Atherton P, Chan L, Frisch N, Glegg S, and Scarrow G (2018) Core knowledge translation competencies: a scoping review.

EBP refers to the implementation of the most up-to-date robust research into clinical practice. Barriers have been well documented and traditionally include the negative beliefs of nurses as well as a lack of time, knowledge, and skills. However, with degree entry nursing and a focus on community health care provision, what has changed? A comprehensive search of contemporary literature (2010-2015) was completed. The findings of this review show that the traditionally acknowledged barriers of a lack of time, knowledge, and skills remained; however, nurses' beliefs toward EBP were more positive, but positive beliefs did not affect the intentions to implement EBP or the knowledge and skills of EBP. Nurses in hospital and community settings reported similar barriers and facilitators.","Comments":"Mallion, Jaimee Brooke, Joanne\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mallion J ; Brooke J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.12968/bjcn.2016.21.3.148","Keywords":"*Attitude of Health Personnel\r\n*Community Health Nursing/og [Organization & Administration]\r\n*Evidence-Based Nursing/og [Organization & Administration]\r\n*Health Knowledge\r\n*Nurse's Role\r\n*Nursing Staff\r\nAttitudes\r\nHospital/px [Psychology]\r\nHumans\r\nPractice\r\nSurveys and Questionnaires","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mallion J, and Brooke J (2016) Community- and hospital-based nurses' implementation of evidence-based practice: are there any differences?.

Facilitators, knowledge brokers and opinion leaders are examples of change agency strategies used to promote knowledge utilization. This review adopts a realist approach and addresses the following question: What change agency characteristics work, for whom do they work, in what circumstances and why? METHODS: The literature reviewed spanned the period 1997-2007. Change agency was operationalized as roles that are aimed at effecting successful change in individuals and organizations. A theoretical framework, developed through stakeholder consultation formed the basis for a search for relevant literature. Team members, working in sub groups, independently themed the data and developed chains of inference to form a series of hypotheses regarding change agency and the role of change agency in knowledge use. RESULTS: 24, 478 electronic references were initially returned from search strategies. Preliminary screening of the article titles reduced the list of potentially relevant papers to 196. A review of full document versions of potentially relevant papers resulted in a final list of 52 papers. The findings add to the knowledge of change agency as they raise issues pertaining to how change agents' function, how individual change agent characteristics effect evidence-informed health care, the influence of interaction between the change agent and the setting and the overall effect of change agency on knowledge utilization. Particular issues are raised such as how accessibility of the change agent, their cultural compatibility and their attitude mediate overall effectiveness. Findings also indicate the importance of promoting reflection on practice and role modeling. The findings of this study are limited by the complexity and diversity of the change agency literature, poor indexing of literature and a lack of theory-driven approaches. CONCLUSION: This is the first realist review of change agency. Though effectiveness evidence is weak, change agent roles are evolving, as is the literature, which requires more detailed description of interventions, outcomes measures, the context, intensity, and levels at which interventions are implemented in order to understand how change agent interventions effect evidence-informed health care.","Comments":"McCormack, Brendan Rycroft-Malone, Joanne Decorby, Kara Hutchinson, Alison M Bucknall, Tracey Kent, Bridie Schultz, Alyce Snelgrove-Clarke, Erna Stetler, Cheyl Titler, Marita Wallin, Lars Wilson, Valerie\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"McCormack B ; Rycroft-Malone J ; Decorby K ; Hutchinson A M; Bucknall T ; Kent B ; Schultz A ; Snelgrove-Clarke E ; Stetler C ; Titler M ; Wallin L ; Wilson V ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1748-5908-8-107","Keywords":"*Diffusion of Innovation\r\n*Evidence-Based Medicine\r\n*Leadership\r\nHumans\r\nOrganizational Innovation\r\nPrimary Health Care","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"McCormack B, Rycroft-Malone J, Decorby K, Hutchinson A M, Bucknall T, Kent B, Schultz A, Snelgrove-Clarke E, Stetler C, Titler M, Wallin L, and Wilson V (2013) A realist review of interventions and strategies to promote evidence-informed healthcare: a focus on change agency.

First-level leaders are individuals who directly supervise and manage frontline employees who do not manage others. However, first-level leadership is underrepresented in existing reviews of the impact of leadership on EBP implementation. This review describes the relationship between first-level leadership and implementation determinants and outcomes. METHODS: A scoping review was performed to synthesize the literature on the relationship between first-level leadership and inner-context and implementation outcomes. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Eric, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science. To be eligible, studies had to examine first-level leadership, be conducted in settings providing behavioral health services, and examine the relationship between first-level leadership and an implementation or inner-context outcome. Data extraction and synthesis were performed to describe study characteristics, leader-outcome relationships, and overlap in leadership frameworks. RESULTS: Twenty-one records met our inclusion criteria. Studies primarily relied on observational designs and were often cross-sectional. Studies more often examined general leadership rather than leadership strategically focused on EBP implementation (i.e., strategic implementation leadership). Our findings suggest that several forms of first-level leadership are inconsistently related to a broad set of implementation determinants, with infrequent examination of specific implementation outcomes. The broad set of implementation determinants studied, limited number of replications, and inconsistent findings have resulted in sparse evidence for any specific leadership-outcome relationship. The greatest accumulation of evidence exists for general leadership's positive relationship with providers' EBP attitudes, most notably in the form of transformational leadership. This was followed by evidence for strategic implementation leadership facilitating general implementation. Our synthesis revealed moderate conceptual overlap of strategic implementation leadership behaviors described in the theory of implementation leadership and theory of middle managers' role in implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that first-level leadership may play an important role in shaping implementation determinants and outcomes, but consistent empirical support is sparse and confidence dampened by methodological issues. To advance the field, we need studies that adopt stronger methodological rigor, address the conceptual overlap in leadership frameworks, examine a broader set of implementation outcomes, and examine conditions under which leadership impacts implementation.

OBJECTIVES Identify individual barriers in the implementation of evidence-based practice (EBP) by nurses. Describe interventions of the programs reviewed in the article that directly affect barriers to clinical nurses' adoption of EBP or the use of research. DISCLOSURE STATEMENT Neither the planners nor the author have any conflicts of interest to disclose. BACKGROUND: Individual barriers such as a lack of research awareness, electronic database navigation skills, and research comprehension prevent nurses from implementing evidence-based practice (EBP). The aim of this review article is to examine EBP programs and their influence on individual barriers among workforce nurses. METHOD: A keyword search of online databases was conducted for original research published from 2004- 2015. A review of cited references and footnote searching of significant articles was conducted to identify additional relevant articles. RESULTS: Twenty articles met the inclusion criteria. Although there was great variation among EBP programs, the majority of participants reported increased awareness, value, belief, knowledge, and skill as it relates to research utilization and EBP. CONCLUSION: This review suggests that individual barriers to EBP may be influenced by clinically based EBP programs. However, a lack of randomized controlled studies and inconsistencies in measurement make it difficult to recommend best practices for developing EBP programs for nurses in the clinical setting.

Yet, there is a paucity of literature in two key areas: emergency RNs' role in PU prevention and their knowledge, skills, attitudes and intentions toward implementation of PU prevention guidelines. Manuscript 1 was an integrative review that found multiple factors---knowledge, attitudes, and environmental---that affect nurses' use of PU prevention. Manuscript 2 was an integrative review that found the readiness for change construct as a precursor to implementing an organizational or individual change. Some nurse researchers suggest a readiness assessment as the first step in the evidence-based practice implementation process. However, research is needed to develop a valid and reliable instrument to measure nurses' readiness for change. Manuscript 3 was a cross-sectional study that found factors from the readiness for change framework and Theory of Planned Behavior significantly influenced emergency RNs' intention to implement pressure ulcer prevention guidelines. Readiness variables of appropriateness and personal valence combined with TPB variables of subjective norm and perceived behavioral control to affect significantly the emergency RNs' intention to implement PU prevention guidelines. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the usefulness of combining the Theory of Planned Behavior and readiness for change construct in order to assess individual intention and readiness for change.","Comments":"Accession Number: 109864122.

The findings of our previous systematic review, published in 2014, indicated that EBP faces numerous barriers. Aim: The present study aimed to update the findings of the previous research by reviewing studies published after 2014. Method: The data were collected by searching the relevant keywords in PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, and Google Scholar between 2014 and 2021. The articles were screened based on their titles, abstracts, and full texts, respectively. The data were extracted using a data extraction form consisting of the author, year, country, type of study, area of study, list of barriers, and their number in each study. Finally, the data was analyzed, summarized, and reported using content analysis by descriptive statistics, such as percentage and frequency. Results: Finally, 77 articles were included in the study. Only 13% of the studies were conducted in low and middle-income countries. The extracted barriers were categorized into five areas of specialized/hospital care, primary health care, rehabilitation care, medical education, and healthcare management and decision making. Based on the content-analysis results, barriers were divided into six main themes: system-level barriers, barriers related to the evidence, individual-related, communicational, resource, patient-related, and external barriers. Lack of time, support, and skills had the highest repetition, respectively. Implications for Practice: The results of our previous study were updated, and further barriers were identified and reported. Policymakers and managers can use the results as a practical guide to expand and improve EBP and remove barriers.","Comments":"research; systematic review; tables/charts.

A secondary goal of this literature review was to determine whether medical–surgical decision‐making literature included factors that appeared to be similar to concepts and factors in naturalistic decision making (NDM). Background: Decision‐making in acute care nursing requires an evaluation of many complex factors. While decision‐making research in acute care nursing is prevalent, errors in decision‐making continue to lead to poor patient outcomes. Naturalistic decision making may provide a framework for further exploring decision‐making in acute care nursing practice. A better understanding of the literature is needed to guide future research to more effectively support acute care nurse decision‐making. Design: PubMed and CINAHL databases were searched, and research meeting criteria was included. Data were identified from all included articles, and themes were developed based on these data. Results: Key findings in this review include nursing experience and associated factors; organisation and unit culture influences on decision‐making; education; understanding patient status; situation awareness; and autonomy. Conclusions: Acute care nurses employ a variety of decision‐making factors and processes and informally identify experienced nurses to be important resources for decision‐making. Incorporation of evidence into acute care nursing practice continues to be a struggle for acute care nurses. This review indicates that naturalistic decision making may be applicable to decision‐making nursing research. Relevance to clinical practice: Experienced nurses bring a broad range of previous patient encounters to their practice influencing their intuitive, unconscious processes which facilitates decision‐making. Using naturalistic decision making as a conceptual framework to guide research may help with understanding how to better support less experienced nurses’ decision‐making for enhanced patient outcomes.","Comments":"research; systematic review; tables/charts.

DATA EXTRACTION: Relevant data were extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: original studies among all healthcare professionals that described the development or use of EBP behaviour assessment tools. RESULTS: Of 19 310 identified articles, 172 studies were included. We identified 117 questionnaires, 10 interviews or focus groups, nine observational studies, 27 chart evaluations and nine studies used a combination of methods. Psychometric properties of the questionnaires used were reported in about half of the studies, in seven studies that assess a single EBM step and in six studies that assess a combination of EBM steps. One of these assessed all five steps of EBP. CONCLUSIONS: Valid and reliable EBP behaviour assessment tools are available. However, only one questionnaire validly assessed all five EBP steps, covering the entire concept of EBP.","Comments":"Oude Rengerink, Katrien Zwolsman, Sandra E Ubbink, Dirk T Mol, Ben W J van Dijk, Nynke Vermeulen, Hester\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Oude Rengerink K; Zwolsman S E; Ubbink D T; Mol B W; van Dijk N ; Vermeulen H ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1136/eb-2012-100969","Keywords":"*Evidence-Based Medicine\r\n*Health Personnel/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data]\r\nEvidence-Based Medicine/mt [Methods]\r\nEvidence-Based Medicine/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data]\r\nEvidence-Based Medicine/st [Standards]\r\nHealth Personnel/st [Standards]\r\nHumans\r\nPsychometrics\r\nSurveys and Questionnaires/st [Standards]","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Oude Rengerink K, Zwolsman S E, Ubbink D T, Mol B W, van Dijk N, and Vermeulen H (2013) Tools to assess evidence-based practice behaviour among healthcare professionals.

METHODS: Two independent investigators conducted an extensive electronic search in EMBASE, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and CINAHL databases from their inception to July 2020 and included the retrieved articles if they investigated barriers to EBP among physiotherapy professionals. Subsequently, they extracted data and assessed the methodological quality using a scale described in a similar previous study. The outcome for meta-analysis was frequency of each reported barrier. Sub-analyses were performed grouping studies based on countries where surveys were performed, classified as either developed or developing countries. RESULTS: Twenty-nine articles were included in the systematic reviews and meta-analysis. Risk of bias assessment of included studies showed a median score: 4 points (interquartile range: 3-4). The findings of meta-analysis revealed that lack of time was the most frequently reported barrier (53.0% [95% confidence interval, 95%CI, 44.0-62.0]), followed by language (36.0% [95%CI 16.0-62.0]), lack of access (34.0% [95%CI 23.0.27]) and lack of statistical skills (31.0% [95%CI 20.0-44.0]). Lack of skills and lack of generalizability were declared as barriers by 27.0% [95%CI 18.0-38.0] and 23.0% [95%CI 15.0-33.0] of responders, respectively. Lack of support and lack of interest are less frequent, with 16.0% [95%CI 11.0-24.0] and 9.0% [95%CI 6.0-15.0] of responses, respectively. Barriers reported in investigations performed in developed countries were less frequent when compared to those performed in developing countries. CONCLUSION: Organizational issues and methodological skills seem key issues to allow the implementation of EBP, suggesting the need to adopt or enhance organizational and training strategies to facilitate the implementation of the EBP. Quantitative synthesis showed high heterogeneity for all analyses, and therefore, pooled data should be interpreted with caution.","Comments":"Using Smart Source Parsing Jun Paci, Matteo Faedda, Gianni Ugolini, Alessandro Pellicciari, Leonardo mzab093\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Paci M ; Faedda G ; Ugolini A ; Pellicciari L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1093/intqhc/mzab093","Keywords":"*Evidence-Based Practice\r\n*Physical Therapy Modalities\r\nHumans","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Paci M, Faedda G, Ugolini A, and Pellicciari L (2021) Barriers to evidence-based practice implementation in physiotherapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

This is a literature review of the attitudes and knowledge of psychiatric nurses about EBP development. A systematic, comprehensive, bibliographic search was made using terms chosen from the USNLM Institutes of Health list of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and free text key terms. Articles were selected based on specific inclusion criteria in terms of titles or abstracts. The search identified 92 potentially relevant papers, of which 6 were included after appraisal by two independent reviewers. The results, which were extracted and synthesized into a narrative text, indicated that although psychiatric nurses are now more aware of and open to the idea of EBP and understand the importance of its implementation in daily practice, their relevant skills remain moderate to low. In general, nurses consider patients and personal experience as their main source of knowledge. Only slightly more than one third considers themselves capable of reviewing, critically appraising and implementing research evidence to change practices. This review confirmed that nurse-patient interaction constitutes an important source of practice knowledge in the psychiatric health care setting. There is a need for further research investigating EBP implementation among psychiatric nurses, which should focus on the predictors of EBP and effective strategies for teaching EBP and enhancing its implementation in psychiatric nursing practice.","Comments":"L618611221 2017-10-11\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Patelarou A E; Katsouli K ; Stamou A ; Vivilaki V ; Koukia E ; Sifaki-Pistolla D ; Patelarou E ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Medical Subject Headings\r\nadult\r\nevidence based practice center\r\nhuman\r\nnarrative\r\nnurse\r\nperception\r\npersonal experience\r\npsychiatric nursing\r\nskill\r\nteaching","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Patelarou A E, Katsouli K, Stamou A, Vivilaki V, Koukia E, Sifaki-Pistolla D, and Patelarou E (2017) Attitudes, knowledge and perceptions of psychiatric nurses about evidence-based practice.

This systematic review aimed to bring together the best methods used to teach EBP to health professionals. The authors conducted a systematic search for the period 2005-2015 (an update of the search took place in October 2016) using PubMed interface (Medline). MeSH terms as well as free-text keywords were used. Studies were analyzed and evaluated by title and abstract. Those studies which fulfilled the inclusion criteria were assessed by full text. References of articles were also taken into consideration for identifying relevant studies not found through algorithm search. Twenty articles were found to be relevant. The majority of the studies were conducted among nurses (n=7) and physicians (n=6), and only a few among professionals from mixed disciplines (n=5). Two studies were conducted among chiropractors (n=1) and faculty members from a naturopathic and classical Chinese medicine institution (n=1). Researchers used a variety of different approaches, which varied with respect to duration and organization. We divided interventions into two categories. Single interventions included either a workshop, or a journal club, or a conference, or a lecture, or online learning tools, whereas multiple interventions included a combination of these approaches. An increase in EBP competencies and attitudes was reported in nine studies. Teaching methods for optimizing EBP among health professionals could become a robust standardized procedure of the medical educational curricula and lifelong learning of health care professionals.","Comments":"Patelarou, Athina E Kyriakoulis, Konstantinos G Stamou, Aliki A Laliotis, Aggelos Sifaki-Pistolla, Dimitra Matalliotakis, Michail Prokopakis, Emmanuel Patelarou, Evridiki\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Patelarou A E; Kyriakoulis K G; Stamou A A; Laliotis A ; Sifaki-Pistolla D ; Matalliotakis M ; Prokopakis E ; Patelarou E ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.2147/amep.s134475","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Patelarou A E, Kyriakoulis K G, Stamou A A, Laliotis A, Sifaki-Pistolla D, Matalliotakis M, Prokopakis E, and Patelarou E (2017) Approaches to teach evidence-based practice among health professionals: an overview of the existing evidence.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline, CINAHL, ERIC, LISA (Library and Information Science Abstracts), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from inception to June 2013. Studies involving librarian-provided services for patients encountering the healthcare system, healthcare providers, or researchers were eligible for inclusion. All librarian-provided services in healthcare settings were considered as an intervention, including hospitals, primary care settings, or public health clinics. RESULTS: Twenty-five articles fulfilled our eligibility criteria, including 22 primary publications and three companion reports. The majority of studies (15/22 primary publications) examined librarians providing instruction in literature searching to healthcare trainees, and measured literature searching proficiency. Other studies analyzed librarian-provided literature searching services and instruction in question formulation as well as the impact of librarian-provided services on patient length of stay in hospital. No studies were found that investigated librarians providing direct services to researchers or patients in healthcare settings. CONCLUSIONS: Librarian-provided services directed to participants in training programs (eg, students, residents) improve skills in searching the literature to facilitate the integration of research evidence into clinical decision-making. Services provided to clinicians were shown to be effective in saving time for health professionals and providing relevant information for decision-making. Two studies indicated patient length of stay was reduced when clinicians requested literature searches related to a patient's case.","Comments":"Perrier, Laure Farrell, Ann Ayala, A Patricia Lightfoot, David Kenny, Tim Aaronson, Ellen Allee, Nancy Brigham, Tara Connor, Elizabeth Constantinescu, Teodora Muellenbach, Joanne Epstein, Helen-Ann Brown Weiss, Ardis\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Perrier L ; Farrell A ; Ayala A P; Lightfoot D ; Kenny T ; Aaronson E ; Allee N ; Brigham T ; Connor E ; Constantinescu T ; Muellenbach J ; Epstein H A; Weiss A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1136/amiajnl-2014-002825","Keywords":"*Information Storage and Retrieval\r\n*Librarians\r\n*Outcome and Process Assessment\r\n*Patient Care\r\nHealth Care\r\nHealth Facilities\r\nHumans","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Perrier L, Farrell A, Ayala A P, Lightfoot D, Kenny T, Aaronson E, Allee N, Brigham T, Connor E, Constantinescu T, Muellenbach J, Epstein H A, and Weiss A (2014) Effects of librarian-provided services in healthcare settings: a systematic review.

EBP combines the best available evidence in the relevant literature with patient preferences and values and healthcare professionals' (HCPs) expertise. METHODS: Systematic searches of ten bibliographic databases, unpublished works, and the Grey Literature Report sought studies published up to 30 September 2022. RESULTS: The 15 studies retained involved 2712 nurses. Three types of effective educational interventions were identified: (1) multifaceted educational strategies incorporating mentoring and tutoring; (2) single educational strategies, often delivered online; and (3) multifaceted educational strategies using the five steps of EBP. Eleven primary outcomes (EBP beliefs, EBP self-efficacy, perceived EBP implementation, EBP competencies, EBP knowledge, EBP skills, EBP attitudes, EBP behaviors, EBP desire, EBP practice, and perceptions of organizational culture and readiness) were assessed using 13 qualitative and quantitative instruments. CONCLUSIONS: Ensuring the successful implementation of EBP requires effective educational strategies. Computer-based learning seems the most cost-effective and efficient strategy, when considering caregivers' characteristics, the clinical field, and educational interventions across the pre-, peri-, and post-implementation processes.","Comments":"Using Smart Source Parsing Nov Portela Dos Santos, Omar Melly, Pauline Hilfiker, Roger Giacomino, Katia Perruchoud, Elodie Verloo, Henk Pereira, Filipa 2204\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Portela Dos Santos, O; Melly P ; Hilfiker R ; Giacomino K ; Perruchoud E ; Verloo H ; Pereira F ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10112204","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Portela Dos Santos, O, Melly P, Hilfiker R, Giacomino K, Perruchoud E, Verloo H, and Pereira F (2022) Effectiveness of Educational Interventions to Increase Skills in Evidence-Based Practice among Nurses: The EDITcare Systematic Review.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: A systematic review with narrative synthesis was conducted. Relevant electronic bibliographic databases and reference lists of pertinent review articles were searched. To be included, a study had to involve empirical research and refer to both leadership and EBP in health care. Study quality was assessed with a structured instrument based on study design. FINDINGS: A total of 17 studies were included. Leadership was mostly viewed as a modifier for implementation success, acting through leadership support. Yet, there was definitional imprecision as well as conceptual inconsistency, and studies seemed to inadequately address situational and contextual factors. Although referring to an organizational factor, the concept was mostly analysed at the individual or group level. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: The concept of leadership in implementation science seems to be not fully developed. It is unclear whether attempts to tap the concept of leadership in available instruments truly capture and measure the full range of the diverse leadership elements at various levels. Research in implementation science would benefit from a better integration of research findings from other disciplinary fields. Once a more mature concept has been established, researchers in implementation science could proceed to further elaborate operationalization and measurement. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: Although the relevance of leadership in implementation science has been acknowledged, the conceptual base of leadership in this field has received only limited attention.","Comments":"Reichenpfader, Ursula Carlfjord, Siw Nilsen, Per\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Reichenpfader U ; Carlfjord S ; Nilsen P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1108/lhs-08-2014-0061","Keywords":"*Evidence-Based Practice\r\n*Leadership\r\nEmpirical Research\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Reichenpfader U, Carlfjord S, and Nilsen P (2015) Leadership in evidence-based practice: a systematic review.

INTRODUCTION: Systematic reviews on the psychometric properties of evidence-based practice measures guide researchers, clinical managers, and educators in selecting an appropriate measure for use. The lack of psychometric standards specific to evidence-based practice measures, in addition to recent findings suggesting the low methodological quality of psychometric systematic reviews, calls into question the quality and methods of systematic reviews examining evidence-based practice measures. INCLUSION CRITERIA: We included systematic reviews that identified measures that assessed evidence-based practice as a whole or of constituent parts (eg, knowledge, attitudes, skills, behaviors), and described the psychometric evidence for any health care professional group irrespective of assessment context (education or clinical practice). METHODS: We searched five databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and ERIC) on January 18, 2021. Two independent reviewers conducted screening, data extraction, and quality appraisal following the JBI approach. A narrative synthesis was performed. RESULTS: Ten systematic reviews, published between 2006 and 2020, were included and focused on the following groups: all health care professionals (n = 3), nurses (n = 2), occupational therapists (n = 2), physical therapists (n = 1), medical students (n = 1), and family medicine residents (n = 1). The overall quality of the systematic reviews was low: none of the reviews assessed the quality of primary studies or adhered to methodological guidelines, and only one registered a protocol. Reporting of psychometric evidence and measurement characteristics differed. While all the systematic reviews discussed internal consistency, feasibility was only addressed by three. Many approaches were used to assess the adequacy of measures, and five systematic reviews referenced tools. Criteria for the adequacy of individual properties and measures varied, but mainly followed standards for patient-reported outcome measures or the Standards of Educational and Psychological Testing. There were 204 unique measures identified across 10 reviews. One review explicitly recommended measures for occupational therapists, three reviews identified adequate measures for all health care professionals, and one review identified measures for medical students. The 27 measures deemed adequate by these five systematic reviews are described. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a need to improve the overall methodological quality and reporting of systematic reviews on evidence-based practice measures to increase the trustworthiness of recommendations and allow comprehensive interpretation by end users. Risk of bias is common to all the included systematic reviews, as the quality of primary studies was not assessed. The diversity of tools and approaches used to evaluate the adequacy of evidence-based practice measures reflects tensions regarding the conceptualization of validity, suggesting a need to reflect on the most appropriate application of validity theory to evidence-based practice measures.

Two reviewers independently extracted excerpts from the results and discussion/conclusion sections of the 10 included SRs that aligned with the three research aims. An iterative six-phase reflexive thematic analysis according to Braun and Clarke was conducted. RESULTS: Our thematic analysis produced five themes describing the main challenges associated with measuring EBP, four themes outlining main recommendations for practice, and four themes representing areas of future research. Challenges include limited psychometric testing and validity evidence for existing EBP measures; limitations with the self-report format; lack of construct clarity of EBP measures; inability to capture the complexity of the EBP process and outcomes; and the context-specific nature of EBP measures. Reported recommendations for practice include acknowledging the multidimensionality of EBP; adapting EBP measures to the context and re-examining the validity argument; and considering the feasibility and acceptability of measures. Areas of future research included the development of comprehensive, multidimensional EBP measures and the need for expert consensus on the operationalization of EBP. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that existing measures may be insufficient in capturing the multidimensional, contextual and dynamic nature of EBP. There is a need for a clear operationalization of EBP and an improved understanding and application of validity theory.","Comments":"Roberge-Dao, Jacqueline Maggio, Lauren A Zaccagnini, Marco Rochette, Annie Shikako, Keiko Boruff, Jill Thomas, Aliki\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Roberge-Dao J ; Maggio L A; Zaccagnini M ; Rochette A ; Shikako K ; Boruff J ; Thomas A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jep.13790","Keywords":"*Data Accuracy\r\n*Evidence-Based Practice\r\nConsensus\r\nEvidence-Based Practice/mt [Methods]\r\nHumans\r\nPsychometrics\r\nSelf Report","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Roberge-Dao J, Maggio L A, Zaccagnini M, Rochette A, Shikako K, Boruff J, and Thomas A (2023) Challenges and future directions in the measurement of evidence-based practice: Qualitative analysis of umbrella review findings.

The aim of this study was to systematically review and carry out an analysis on the barriers to EBM. METHODS: Different database searching methods and also manual search were employed in this study using the search words ('evidence-based' or 'evidence-based medicine' or 'evidence-based practice' or 'evidence-based guidelines' or 'research utilization') and (barrier* or challenge or hinder) in the following databases: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, Cochrane library, Pro Quest, Magiran, SID. RESULTS: Out of 2592 articles, 106 articles were finally identified for study. Research barriers, lack of resources, lack of time, inadequate skills, and inadequate access, lack of knowledge and financial barriers were found to be the most common barriers to EBM. Examples of these barriers were found in primary care, hospital/specialist care, rehabilitation care, medical education, management and decision making. The most common barriers to research utilization were research barriers, cooperation barriers and changing barriers. Lack of resources was the most common barrier to implementation of guidelines. CONCLUSION: The result of this study shows that there are many barriers to the implementation and use of EBM. Identifying barriers is just the first step to removing barriers to the use of EBM. Extra resources will be needed if these barriers are to be tackled.","Comments":"Sadeghi-Bazargani, Homayoun Tabrizi, Jafar Sadegh Azami-Aghdash, Saber\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sadeghi-Bazargani H ; Tabrizi J S; Azami-Aghdash S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jep.12222","Keywords":"*Evidence-Based Medicine/og [Organization & Administration]\r\n*Health Knowledge\r\n*Practice Guidelines as Topic\r\n*Practice Patterns\r\n*Quality Assurance\r\nAttitudes\r\nClinical Competence\r\nCommunication Barriers\r\nDelivery of Health Care/og [Organization & Administration]\r\nFemale\r\nGuideline Adherence\r\nHealth Care/og [Organization & Administration]\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nPhysicians'/og [Organization & Administration]\r\nPractice","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sadeghi-Bazargani H, Tabrizi J S, and Azami-Aghdash S (2014) Barriers to evidence-based medicine: a systematic review.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify barriers concerning application of electronic literature on evidence based practice in nursing. METHODS: Six bibliographic databases were searched using the following keywords: challenges, barriers, obstacles, evidence based practice, EBP, information seeking, online databases, electronic literature, bibliographic databases and nurs*. Results were filtered to peer reviewed empirical studies, written in English or Persian and published from 2010 to 2017. Studies were selected based on specified inclusion criteria, and quality of the included studies was assessed. The approved articles (n = 21) were extracted and synthesised. DISCUSSION: There are different types of barriers in using electronic evidence based literature in nursing demonstrating the issue as a multi-faceted problem. Not having enough time to conduct a search was the first major barrier noted by almost 81% (n = 17) of the reviewed studies followed by lack of knowledge on searching skills (66%; n = 14) and access requirements (38%; n = 8). CONCLUSIONS: There appears to be an important role for hospital management in providing nurses with enough time and access to online information while at work and also for health care librarians together with nursing leaders in providing the required training on using electronic evidence based literature.","Comments":"Sadoughi, Farahnaz Azadi, Tania Azadi, Tannaz\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sadoughi F ; Azadi T ; Azadi T ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/hir.12186","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sadoughi F, Azadi T, and Azadi T (2017) Barriers to using electronic evidence based literature in nursing practice: a systematised review.

The literature, however, provides limited insight into the process of EBMgt and its contextual nuances. Such insight is critical for better leveraging EBMgt in practice. Therefore, the authors' aim was to integrate the literature on the process of EBMgt in hospital settings, identify the gaps in knowledge and delineate areas for future research. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The authors conducted a systematic scoping review using an innovative methodology that involved two systematic searches. First using EBMgt terminology and second using terminology associated with the EBMgt concept, which the authors derived from the first search. FINDINGS: The authors identified 218 relevant articles, which using content analysis, they mapped onto the grounded model of the EBMgt process; a novel model of the EBMgt process developed by Sahakian and colleagues. The authors found that the English language literature provides limited insight into the role of managers' perceptions and motives in EBMgt, the practice of EBMgt in Global South countries, and the outcomes of EBMgt. Overall, this study's findings indicated that aspects of the decision-maker, context and outcomes have been neglected in EBMgt. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The authors contributed to the EBMgt literature by identifying these gaps and proposing future research areas and to the systematic review literature by developing a novel scoping review method.","Comments":"Sahakian, Tina Daouk-Oyry, Lina Kroon, Brigitte Kooij, Dorien T A M Alameddine, Mohamad\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sahakian T ; Daouk-Oyry L ; Kroon B ; Kooij Dtam ; Alameddine M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1108/jhom-03-2021-0101","Keywords":"*covid-19\r\nHospitals\r\nHumans\r\nSARS-CoV-2","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sahakian T, Daouk-Oyry L, Kroon B, Kooij Dtam, and Alameddine M (2021) The neglected contexts and outcomes of evidence-based management: a systematic scoping review in hospital settings.

DESIGN: This is a systematic review and meta-analytic paper. DATA SOURCES: Published and unpublished studies in English were searched from 10 databases from 2005 to 2021. REVIEW METHODS: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and clinical controlled trials (CCTs) describing education interventions to improve EBP knowledge, skills, attitude, confidence and behaviours among nurses were eligible. Two reviewers independently screened, appraised and extracted data. Meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effect model to synthesise data using review manager software. Standardised mean difference (SMD) represented an effect measure. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran-Q square test and I square statistics. Subgroup and narrative synthesis were also conducted. RESULTS: Ten studies (6 RCTs and 4 CCTs) were selected for this review. Results from a CCT suggested that education interventions improved EBP knowledge with a large effect size (SMD=2.01). Education interventions also enhanced EBP skills (n=1), combined knowledge/skills (SMD=0.48, N=5), attitude toward EBP (SMD=0.39, N=4), confidence to conduct EBP (SMD=0.43, n=1) and EBP behaviour (SMD=0.26, n=5). None of the studies used patient-related outcomes. CONCLUSION: Overall, education interventions improved nurses' EBP knowledge, skills, attitude, confidence and behaviour. EBP education interventions should be part of nurses' professional development in clinical settings. The interventions may be delivered through combined lectures, group discussions, hands-on practice via face-to-face and/or online learning. Future research should test education interventions using RCTs, large sample size, and in-depth qualitative data.","Comments":"Sapri, Nur Diyana Ng, Yan Ting Wu, Vivien Xi Klainin-Yobas, Piyanee S0260-6917(22)00031-4\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sapri N D; Ng Y T; Wu V X; Klainin-Yobas P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2022.105295","Keywords":"*Education\r\n*Evidence-Based Practice\r\nDelivery of Health Care\r\nDistance\r\nHumans\r\nKnowledge","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sapri N D, Ng Y T, Wu V X, and Klainin-Yobas P (2022) Effectiveness of educational interventions on evidence-based practice for nurses in clinical settings: A systematic review and meta-analysis.

Therefore, it is important to determine how to improve evidence-informed decision-making. The primary aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of research implementation strategies for promoting evidence-informed policy and management decisions in healthcare. The secondary aim of the review was to describe factors perceived to be associated with effective strategies and the inter-relationship between these factors. METHODS: An electronic search was developed to identify studies published between January 01, 2000, and February 02, 2016. This was supplemented by checking the reference list of included articles, systematic reviews, and hand-searching publication lists from prominent authors. Two reviewers independently screened studies for inclusion, assessed methodological quality, and extracted data. RESULTS: After duplicate removal, the search strategy identified 3830 titles. Following title and abstract screening, 96 full-text articles were reviewed, of which 19 studies (21 articles) met all inclusion criteria. Three studies were included in the narrative synthesis, finding policy briefs including expert opinion might affect intended actions, and intentions persisting to actions for public health policy in developing nations. Workshops, ongoing technical assistance, and distribution of instructional digital materials may improve knowledge and skills around evidence-informed decision-making in US public health departments. Tailored, targeted messages were more effective in increasing public health policies and programs in Canadian public health departments compared to messages and a knowledge broker. Sixteen studies (18 articles) were included in the thematic synthesis, leading to a conceptualisation of inter-relating factors perceived to be associated with effective research implementation strategies. A unidirectional, hierarchal flow was described from (1) establishing an imperative for practice change, (2) building trust between implementation stakeholders and (3) developing a shared vision, to (4) actioning change mechanisms. This was underpinned by the (5) employment of effective communication strategies and (6) provision of resources to support change. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence is developing to support the use of research implementation strategies for promoting evidence-informed policy and management decisions in healthcare. The design of future implementation strategies should be based on the inter-relating factors perceived to be associated with effective strategies.

DESIGN: An integrative review study. DATA SOURCES: Thirty-seven (37) primary research studies on nurses' readiness for evidence-based practice, of which 30 were descriptive cross-sectional surveys, 5 were pretest-posttest studies, and one study each was an experimental pilot study and a descriptive qualitative study. Included studies were published from the beginning of 2004 through end of January 2015. REVIEW METHODS: The integrative review study used thematic synthesis, in which the quantitative studies were analyzed deductively and the qualitative studies inductively. Outcomes related to nurses' readiness for evidence-based practice were grouped according to the four main themes that emerged from the thematic synthesis: (1) nurses' familiarity with evidence-based practice (EBP); (2) nurses' attitudes toward and beliefs about evidence-based practice; (3) nurses' evidence-based practice knowledge and skills; and (4) nurses' use of research in practice. Methodological quality of the included studies was evaluated with Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools. RESULTS: Although nurses were familiar with, had positive attitudes toward, and believed in the value of EBP in improving care quality and patient outcomes, they perceived their own evidence-based practice knowledge and skills insufficient for employing evidence-based practice, and did not use best evidence in practice. The vast majority (81%) of included studies were descriptive cross-sectional surveys, 84% used a non-probability sampling method, sample sizes were small, and response rates low. Most included studies were of modest quality. CONCLUSIONS: More robust, theoretically-based and psychometrically sound nursing research studies are needed to test and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions designed to advance nurses' evidence-based practice competencies, especially teaching them how to integrate evidence-based practice into clinical decision-making. All efforts should be focused on systematically using knowledge transformation strategies shown to be effective in rigorous studies, to translate best evidence into practice-friendly, readily usable forms that are easily accessible to nurses to integrate into their clinical practice.","Comments":"Saunders, Hannele Vehvilainen-Julkunen, Katri S0020-7489(15)00335-1\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Saunders H ; Vehvilainen-Julkunen K ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2015.10.018","Keywords":"*Evidence-Based Nursing\r\n*Nursing Staff/px [Psychology]\r\nHumans","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Saunders H, and Vehvilainen-Julkunen K (2016) The state of readiness for evidence-based practice among nurses: An integrative review.

The multistep EBP implementation process requires multifaceted competencies to successfully integrate best evidence into daily healthcare delivery. AIMS: To summarize and synthesize the current research literature on practicing health professionals' EBP competencies (i.e., their knowledge, skills, attitudes, beliefs, and implementation) related to employing EBP in clinical decision-making. DESIGN: An overview of systematic reviews. METHODS: PubMed/MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scopus, and Cochrane Library were systematically searched on practicing healthcare professionals' EBP competencies published in January 2012-July 2017. A total of 3,947 publications were retrieved, of which 11 systematic reviews were eligible for a critical appraisal of methodological quality. Three independent reviewers conducted the critical appraisal using the Rapid Critical Appraisal tools developed by the Helene Fuld National Institute for Evidence-Based Practice in Nursing & Healthcare. RESULTS: Practicing healthcare professionals' self-reported EBP knowledge, skills, attitudes, and beliefs were at a moderate to high level, but they did not translate into EBP implementation. Considerable overlap existed in the source studies across the included reviews. Few reviews reported any impact of EBP competencies on changes in care processes or patient outcomes. Most reviews were methodologically of moderate quality. Significant variation in study designs, settings, interventions, and outcome measures in the source studies precluded any comparisons of EBP competencies across healthcare disciplines. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: As EBP is a shared competency, the development, adoption, and use of an EBP competency set for all healthcare professionals are a priority along with using actual (i.e., performance-based), validated outcome measures. The widespread misconceptions and misunderstandings that still exist among large proportions of practicing healthcare professionals about the basic concepts of EBP should urgently be addressed to increase engagement in EBP implementation and attain improved care quality and patient outcomes.","Comments":"Saunders, Hannele Gallagher-Ford, Lynn Kvist, Tarja Vehvilainen-Julkunen, Katri\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Saunders H ; Gallagher-Ford L ; Kvist T ; Vehvilainen-Julkunen K ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/wvn.12363","Keywords":"*Systematic Reviews as Topic\r\nClinical Competence/st [Standards]\r\nEvidence-Based Practice/ed [Education]\r\nEvidence-Based Practice/mt [Methods]\r\nEvidence-Based Practice/td [Trends]\r\nHumans\r\nQuality of Health Care","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Saunders H, Gallagher-Ford L, Kvist T, and Vehvilainen-Julkunen K (2019) Practicing Healthcare Professionals' Evidence-Based Practice Competencies: An Overview of Systematic Reviews.

BACKGROUND: The variety of evidence-based practice models and frameworks, complex terminology and organizational culture challenges nurses in selecting the model that best fits their practice setting. DATA SOURCES: The authors: (1) initially identified models described in a predominant nursing text; (2) searched the literature through CINAHL from 1998 to current year, using combinations of 'evidence', 'evidence-based practice', 'models', 'nursing' and 'research'; (3) refined the list of selected models based on the initial literature review; and (4) conducted a second search of the literature on the selected models for all available years to locate both historical and recent articles on their use in nursing practice. DISCUSSION: Authors described model key features and provided an evaluation of model usefulness based on specific criteria, which focused on facilitating the evidence-based practice process and guiding practice change. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: The evaluation of model usefulness can be used to determine the best fit of the models to the practice setting. CONCLUSION: The Johns Hopkins Model and the Academic Center for Evidence-Based Practice Star Model emphasize the processes of finding and evaluating evidence that is likely to appeal to nursing educators. Organizations may prefer the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services Framework, Advancing Research and Clinical Practice Through Close Collaboration, or Iowa models for their emphasis on team decision-making. An evidence-based practice model that is clear to the clinician and fits the organization will guide a systematic approach to evidence review and practice change.","Comments":"Schaffer, Marjorie A Sandau, Kristin E Diedrick, Lee\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Schaffer M A; Sandau K E; Diedrick L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2648.2012.06122.x","Keywords":"*Evidence-Based Practice\r\n*Models\r\n*Organizational Innovation\r\nOrganizational","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Schaffer M A, Sandau K E, and Diedrick L (2013) Evidence-based practice models for organizational change: overview and practical applications.

OBJECTIVES: Synthesise the findings of research into EBP barriers, facilitators and interventions in physiotherapy and identify methods of enhancing adoption and implementation. DATA SOURCES: Literature concerning physiotherapists' practice between 2000 and 2012 was systematically searched using: Academic Search Complete, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature Plus, American Psychological Association databases, Medline, Journal Storage, and Science Direct. Reference lists were searched to identify additional studies. STUDY SELECTION: Thirty-two studies, focusing either on physiotherapists' EBP knowledge, attitudes or implementation, or EBP interventions in physiotherapy were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: One author undertook all data extraction and a second author reviewed to ensure consistency and rigour. Synthesis was organised around the themes of EBP barriers/enablers, attitudes, knowledge/skills, use and interventions. RESULTS: Many physiotherapists hold positive attitudes towards EBP. However, this does not necessarily translate into consistent, high-quality EBP. Many barriers to EBP implementation are apparent, including: lack of time and skills, and misperceptions of EBP. LIMITATIONS: Only studies published in the English language, in peer-reviewed journals were included, thereby introducing possible publication bias. Furthermore, narrative synthesis may be subject to greater confirmation bias. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: There is no \"one-size fits all\" approach to enhancing EBP implementation; assessing organisational culture prior to designing interventions is crucial. Although some interventions appear promising, further research is required to explore the most effective methods of supporting physiotherapists' adoption of EBP.","Comments":"Scurlock-Evans, Laura Upton, Penney Upton, Dominic Comment in (CIN) S0031-9406(14)00027-3\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Scurlock-Evans L ; Upton P ; Upton D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physio.2014.03.001","Keywords":"*Physical Therapy Modalities\r\nAttitudes\r\nEvidence-Based Practice\r\nHealth Care\r\nHealth Knowledge\r\nHumans\r\nPractice\r\nQuality Assurance","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Scurlock-Evans L, Upton P, and Upton D (2014) Evidence-based practice in physiotherapy: a systematic review of barriers, enablers and interventions.

Precise use of best evidence from different sources for increasing the desired outcomes is the result of EBM. Therefore, this study aimed to map the potential facilitators and barriers to EBM in health systems to help the healthcare managers to better implement EBM in their organizations. METHODS: The present study was a scoping review (SR) conducted in 2020 based on the integration of the frameworks presented by Arksey and O'Malley (2005) and Levac et al. (2010) considering the Joanna Briggs Institute guideline (2015). These frameworks consist of 6 steps. After finalizing the search strategy, 7 databases were searched, and the PRISMA-ScR was used to manage the retrieval and inclusion of the evidence. Microsoft Excel 2013 was used to extract the data, and the graphic description was presented. The summative analysis approach was used applying MAXQDA10. RESULTS: According to the systematic search, 4815 studies were retrieved after eliminating duplicates and unrelated articles, 49 articles remained to extract EBM facilitators and barriers. Six main aspects attitude toward EBM, external factors, contextual factors, resources, policies and procedures, and research capacity and data availability were summarized as EBM facilitators. The barriers to EBM were similarly summarized as attitude toward EBM, external factors, contextual factors, policies and procedures, limited resources, and research capacity and data availability. The streamgraphs describe that the international attention to the sub-aspects of facilitators and barriers of EBM has been increased since 2011. CONCLUSIONS: The importance of decision-making regarding complex health systems, especially in terms of resource constraints and uncertainty conditions, requires EBM in the health system as much as possible. Identifying the factors that facilitate the use of evidence, as well as its barriers to management and decision-making in the organization, can play an important role in making systematic and reliable decisions that can be defended by the officials and ultimately lead to greater savings in organization resources and prevent them from being wasted.","Comments":"Shafaghat, Tahereh Imani Nasab, Mohammad Hasan Bahrami, Mohammad Amin Kavosi, Zahra Roozrokh Arshadi Montazer, Mahsa Rahimi Zarchi, Mohammad Kazem Bastani, Peivand\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Shafaghat T ; Imani Nasab ; M H ; Bahrami M A; Kavosi Z ; Roozrokh Arshadi Montazer, M; Rahimi Zarchi ; M K ; Bastani P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-021-01595-8","Keywords":"*Delivery of Health Care\r\n*Organizations\r\nHumans","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Shafaghat T, Imani Nasab, M H, Bahrami M A, Kavosi Z, Roozrokh Arshadi Montazer, M, Rahimi Zarchi, M K, and Bastani P (2021) A mapping of facilitators and barriers to evidence-based management in health systems: a scoping review study.

The key terms used to search relevant articles include: \"Healthcare and Knowledge Management\"; \"Knowledge Management Tools in Healthcare\" and \"Community of Practices in healthcare\". RESULTS: It was found that utilization of knowledge management in healthcare is encouraging. There exist numbers of opportunities for knowledge management implementation, though there are some barriers as well. Some of the opportunities that can transform healthcare are advances in health information and communication technology, clinical decision support systems, electronic health record systems, communities of practice and advanced care planning. CONCLUSION: Providing the right knowledge at the right time, i.e., at the point of decision making by implementing knowledge management in healthcare is paramount. To do so, it is very important to use appropriate tools for knowledge management and user-friendly system because it can significantly improve the quality and safety of care provided for patients both at hospital and home settings.","Comments":"Shahmoradi, Leila Safadari, Reza Jimma, Worku\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Shahmoradi L ; Safadari R ; Jimma W ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"*Clinical Decision-Making/mt [Methods]\r\n*Evidence-Based Practice/mt [Methods]\r\n*Knowledge Management\r\nHumans","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Shahmoradi L, Safadari R, and Jimma W (2017) Knowledge Management Implementation and the Tools Utilized in Healthcare for Evidence-Based Decision Making: A Systematic Review.

The approach has been widely embraced; however, an evidence-to-practice gap still exists. AIM: To assess barriers to EBP among nurses in low- and middle-income countries. METHODS: This review conforms to the PRISMA statement. Databases PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, and Web of Science/Knowledge were searched using a combination of keywords that included \"barriers,\" \"evidence-based practice,\" and \"nurses.\" The references of the selected articles were also hand-searched to obtain additional relevant articles. Studies published in peer-reviewed journals in English between 2000 and 2018 were included in the review. RESULTS: Sixteen articles were included in the analysis, with a total number of 8,409 participants. Both qualitative and quantitative studies were included in the review. Three main themes emerged from eight categories found. The three main themes were institutional-related barriers, interdisciplinary barriers, and nurse-related barriers. The theme of institutional-related barriers emerged from four categories, which included scant resources, limited access to information, inadequate staffing, and lack of institutional support. The theme of interdisciplinary barriers emerged from subcategories that included lack of communication between academic and clinical practice environments, inconsistency between education and practice in the nursing discipline, lack of teamwork, and the public's negative image about the nursing profession. Finally, the theme of nurse-related barriers emerged from categories including perceived limitations in the scope of nurses' practice, time, knowledge of EBP, and individual-related barriers. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: These findings may guide the design of future interventions aimed at fostering EBP. Implementing EBP in practice should be systematic and requires institutional will and interdisciplinary and individual commitment. It should be a collective goal and a win-win situation for nurses, clinicians, and healthcare organizations.","Comments":"Shayan, Shah Jahan Kiwanuka, Frank Nakaye, Zainah\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Shayan S J; Kiwanuka F ; Nakaye Z ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/wvn.12337","Keywords":"*Evidence-Based Practice/mt [Methods]\r\n*Nurses/td [Trends]\r\n*Translational Research\r\nBiomedical/st [Standards]\r\nDeveloping Countries\r\nEvidence-Based Practice/st [Standards]\r\nHumans","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Shayan S J, Kiwanuka F, and Nakaye Z (2019) Barriers Associated With Evidence-Based Practice Among Nurses in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A Systematic Review.

Recent research explores the dimensions of evidence-based practice; however, the implementation of evidence-based clinical decision making has been identified as a cumbersome process. Aim: This study aimed to review the literature systematically regarding the system factors and their possible impacts on the process of evidence-based practice implementation. Method: An electronic search on major databases, including MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, ProQuest, Google Scholar, and CINAHL was conducted from January 2018 to March 2018. A rigorous selection process focusing on the inclusion of nurses in the study population and the system factors related to their practices resulted in the selection of 18 articles. Data were extracted from the studies and grouped into categories using a thematic analysis. Results: The factors affecting the nurses' evidence-based practice were identified at the individual, team, and organizational culture levels. The individual domain included a lack of education and clinical expertise, inadequate research skills, time constraint, and low levels of confidence and autonomy in changing practices. The factors identified at the team level associated with a lack of research orientation and peer support. At the organizational culture level, poor research culture and infrastructure were identified as important factors. Implications for Practice: The findings of the system factors would help policymakers to redefine the nursing practice. Moreover, the results raise the nurse's awareness about the importance of using evidence-based practice in decision making.","Comments":"research; systematic review; tables/charts.

AIMS: This systematic review aimed to summarize, describe, and evaluate the measurement properties of the instruments that evaluate the use of Evidence-Based Practice in health professionals. METHODS: The search was carried out in four databases considering three groups of search terms: evidence-based practice, evaluation, and measurement proprieties. Studies were included that described the use of instruments to assess Evidence-Based Practice in health professionals, with the full-text publication, which analyzed the measurement properties, in English. The methodological quality of the studies was evaluated using COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments. RESULTS: In total, 6,429 were found and only 92 were eligible for data analysis. Forty new instruments were identified most were developed for nursing and physical therapist. The investigators performed at least 1 type of validity test on 73% of the instruments. Reliability was tested at 90%, through internal consistency. Responsiveness was tested on less than half of the instruments (30%). Most of the instruments identified are reliable and valid to measure evidence-based practice in health professionals. CONCLUSION: Although the Fresno Test remains the most complete instrument, and adequate for use. The COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments checklist classified 7 (seven) instruments as suitable for the target audience.","Comments":"Silva, Anderson Martins da Valentim, Daniela Pereira Martins, Adriana Leite Padula, Rosimeire Simprini\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Silva A M.

However, there is no strong evidence linking EBM training to changes in clinical practice or patient outcomes. This systematic review investigates whether EBM training leads to sustained improvements in doctors' knowledge and practice behaviors that may also facilitate changes in patient outcomes and experiences. A literature search was undertaken in Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, The Cochrane Library, ERIC and Scopus. Studies published from 1997 to 2016 that assessed outcomes of EBM educational interventions amongst doctors and used measures of knowledge, skills, attitudes, practice or patient outcomes were included. Fifteen studies were included in the analysis: four randomized controlled trials (RCTs), three non-RCTs, and eight before-after (longitudinal cohort) studies. Heterogeneity among studies prevented meaningful comparisons. Varying degrees of bias due to the use of subjective measures were identified, limiting study validity. Results showed that EBM interventions can improve short-term knowledge and skills, but there is little reliable evidence of changes in long-term knowledge, attitudes, and clinical practice. No study measured improvement in patient outcomes or experiences. EBM training for medical practitioners needs to incorporate measures of behavioral changes while incorporating patient outcomes and experience measures.","Comments":"Simons, Mary R Zurynski, Yvonne Cullis, Jeremy Morgan, Michael K Davidson, Andrew S\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Simons M R; Zurynski Y ; Cullis J ; Morgan M K; Davidson A S; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/0142159x.2018.1503646","Keywords":"*Education\r\n*Evidence-Based Medicine\r\n*Health Knowledge\r\n*Physicians/px [Psychology]\r\nAttitudes\r\nHumans\r\nMedical/mt [Methods]\r\nPatient Satisfaction\r\nPractice\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Simons M R, Zurynski Y, Cullis J, Morgan M K, and Davidson A S (2019) Does evidence-based medicine training improve doctors' knowledge, practice and patient outcomes?

Both EBM and SDM appear to be taught separately and their combined role in providing high-quality patient care has not yet been explored. DESIGN: Scoping review of literature from January 2017 to June 2021. SETTING: Any setting where doctors in training could undertake EBM and/or SDM courses (hospitals, universities, clinics and online). PARTICIPANTS: Doctors in training (also known as junior doctors, residents, registrars, trainees, fellows) defined as medical graduates undertaking further training to establish a career pathway. METHODS: Searches were conducted in the databases Medline, Embase, Scopus and Cochrane Library. Bibliographies of included articles and their cited references were hand searched and assessed for inclusion. Included studies described training and outcomes of either EBM, SDM or both. Reported outcomes included EBM knowledge and skill tests, attitude surveys, SDM checklists and surveys and patient and doctor experience data obtained from surveys, focus groups and interviews. RESULTS: Of the 26 included studies, 15 described EBM training courses, 10 described SDM training courses and 1 course combined both EBM and SDM. Courses were heterogeneous in their content and outcomes, making comparisons difficult. EBM courses prioritised quantitative outcome assessments and linked knowledge and skills, such as critical appraisal, but overlooked other key elements of patient-centred care including SDM. CONCLUSIONS: SDM and EBM are taught separately in most training courses. The inclusion of SDM, evaluated by qualitative assessments, is currently omitted, yet could provide a more person-centred care focus in EBM courses and should be investigated to increase our knowledge of the effectiveness of such courses and their role in improving doctors' skills and patient care. PROTOCOL: A protocol for this review has been published and contains further details of the methodology.","Comments":"Simons, Mary Rapport, Frances Zurynski, Yvonne Stoodley, Marcus Cullis, Jeremy Davidson, Andrew S\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Simons M ; Rapport F ; Zurynski Y ; Stoodley M ; Cullis J ; Davidson A S; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-057335","Keywords":"*Physicians\r\nAttitude\r\nDecision Making\r\nEvidence-Based Medicine/ed [Education]\r\nHumans\r\nPatient-Centered Care\r\nShared","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Simons M, Rapport F, Zurynski Y, Stoodley M, Cullis J, and Davidson A S (2022) Links between evidence-based medicine and shared decision-making in courses for doctors in training: a scoping review.

Barriers to EBP at individual level have been assessed using questionnaires. Knowing which EBP dimensions are actually explored in these questionnaires is essential to promote EBP and its adoption. OBJECTIVES: To identify and describe questionnaires that have been used among dietitians to evaluate knowledge, skills, attitudes and/or behaviors related to EBP, and to perform a content analysis of these, drawn on the EBP dimensions explored. METHODS: Questionnaires were identified through a systematic review in MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINHAL (last search: 11.2022). Eligibility criteria were: studies using, evaluating or developing questionnaire(s) meant to evaluate knowledge, skills, attitudes and/or behaviors related to EBP among dietitians. The content analysis was conducted to identify the EBP dimensions explored (research evidence, professional expertise, and/or patient's values and circumstances). Questionnaires' items were categorized as follows: one sole EBP dimension, a combination of these or no identifiable dimension. RESULTS: 30 reports (25 studies) were included. The analysis of the 847 items extracted from the 25 questionnaires used showed that the main EBP dimension explored was the integration of research evidence into decision making, found in 75% of items, sole or in combination with another dimension. Professional expertise was explored in 18% of the items, while patient's values and circumstances were found in 3% of them and the combination of these three dimensions in less than 1%. CONCLUSION: The important imbalance of explored EBP dimensions in the questionnaires used may lead to a partial and misleading evaluation that prevents efficient strategies to foster EBP. There is an important need to develop more integrative and accurate evaluations of EBP targeting dietitians, to promote and develop high-quality dietetics practice.","Comments":"Using Smart Source Parsing Sep Soguel, L Lapointe, A Burnand, B Desroches, S S2212-2672(23)01515-0\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Soguel L ; Lapointe A ; Burnand B ; Desroches S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2023.08.134","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Soguel L, Lapointe A, Burnand B, and Desroches S (2023) Descriptive and content analysis of questionnaires used to assess evidence-based practice among dietitians: a systematic review.

The goal of this study is to identify how active e-learning for evidence-based practice (EBP) was implemented in academic settings. METHOD: For a scoping review, literature from PubMed, CINAHL, and EMBASE was searched with keywords related to e-learning and EBP, and only articles pertaining to nursing academic settings were selected. Finally, 17 studies were included. Data on theories or instructional strategies and types and characteristics of online activities were extracted. RESULTS: Of the included studies, 14 had a pedagogical background. Frequently used activities included discussions, asynchronous communications, and a combination of student-student and student-teacher interactions. Critical appraisal was the primary learning content. CONCLUSION: This study summarizes evidence on active learning to enhance the EBP competency of nursing students through e-learning. To make EBP e-learning more meaningful, educators should plan, apply, and evaluate appropriate online activities. <b>[J Contin Educ Nurs. 2021;52(9):407-412.]</b>.","Comments":"Song, Chi Eun Park, Hyunyoung\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Song C E; Park H ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.3928/00220124-20210804-05","Keywords":"*Computer-Assisted Instruction\r\n*Education\r\n*Students\r\nEvidence-Based Nursing\r\nHumans\r\nNursing\r\nProblem-Based Learning","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Song C E, and Park H (2021) Active Learning in E-Learning Programs for Evidence-Based Nursing in Academic Settings: A Scoping Review.

This study sought to synthesize the results of these qualitative studies, taking the variability across context (i.e., medical disciplines, career stages, practice settings, and time of study) into account. METHOD: The authors searched PubMed through April 26, 2012, and independently selected studies according to prespecified criteria for relevance and methodological quality. Additionally, they performed a thematic synthesis through line-by-line interpretation, coding, and thematic arrangement of information. RESULTS: The search resulted in 1,211 publications, of which 30 studies were included. Five major themes emerged on barriers and facilitators for doctors' use of EBM: individual mind-set, professional group norms, EBM competencies, balance between confidence and critical reflection, and managerial collaboration. The authors found particular barriers and facilitators across career stages. Although clinical experience and professional status were perceived to be helpful, they could also prevent doctors from identifying information needs and adopting new evidence. Although residents' lack of clinical experience raised awareness of information needs, residents perceived lack of clinical experience and their hierarchical dependence on staff as barriers to articulating information needs and to translating and introducing evidence to patient care. CONCLUSIONS: Encouragement of group norms for safe communication and shared learning across career stages is perceived as the most prominent facilitator for EBM.","Comments":"Swennen, Maartje H J van der Heijden, Geert J M G Boeije, Hennie R van Rheenen, Nanda Verheul, Floor J M van der Graaf, Yolanda Kalkman, Cor J Comment in (CIN)\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Swennen M H; van der Heijden G J; Boeije H R; van Rheenen N ; Verheul F J; van der Graaf Y ; Kalkman C J; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0b013e31829ed3cc","Keywords":"*Attitude of Health Personnel\r\n*Evidence-Based Medicine/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data]\r\n*Physicians\r\nHumans\r\nPractice Guidelines as Topic\r\nQualitative Research","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Swennen M H, van der Heijden G J, Boeije H R, van Rheenen N, Verheul F J, van der Graaf Y, and Kalkman C J (2013) Doctors' perceptions and use of evidence-based medicine: a systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies.

The purpose of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to enhance HCMs use of research evidence in practice. METHODS: We carried out a systematic review and focus groups to validate the review findings. We searched 10 electronic databases for studies reporting on interventions for HCMs to enhance research utilization in their practice. Qualitative studies were analysed using Hoon's approach to meta-synthesis. RESULTS: Seven, primarily qualitative, studies of varying quality (reported in 11 articles) met our inclusion criteria. Interventions to enhance research use by HCMs included: informal and formal training, computer-based application, executive-level knowledge translation activities and residency programmes. Studies did not report efficacy of interventions or impacts of increasing managers' use of research on staff or patient outcomes. Meta-synthesis yielded four contextual factors influencing the perceived effectiveness of interventions to enhance research use by HCMs: organizational culture, competing priorities, time as a resource and capacity building. Included studies differed in how they defined research and demonstrated varying understandings of research among HCMs, limiting the generalizability of work in this field. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare managers are increasingly called upon to make evidence-based decisions in practice, but the small number of studies and diverse strategies employed hinder our ability to identify any intervention to increase use of evidence as superior. Future studies in this area should clearly articulate the definition of research evidence they base their decisions on.

BACKGROUND: Evidence-based nursing practice is the cornerstone of quality patient care and merits system-wide implementation. Achieving system-wide spread of evidence-based innovations requires adoption of four benefit levers (the facilitators for spreading innovations), conceptualized by Edwards and Grinspun: alignment, leadership for change, permeation plans and supporting and reinforcing structures. Although these concepts have been explored and described in primary studies, they were only recently identified as benefit levers and their characteristics have not been reviewed in the context of health care using an integrative literature review. DESIGN: An integrative literature review using an adapted Whittemore and Knafl design. DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive search using multiple sites such as Scopus, EBSCOhost, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, Nexus, SAePublications, Sabinet, Google Scholar and grey literature was conducted (January-March 2012) and updated (December 2014). After reading the abstracts, titles and full-text articles, forty (N = 40) research and non-research documents met the inclusion criteria. REVIEW METHODS: Thirty-five documents remained after critical appraisal. A systematic approach was used to analyse and synthesize the data and formulate concluding statements. RESULTS: Data revealed characteristics about alignment (personal, organizational and contextual attributes), permeation plans (phases), leadership for change (types, strategies, position, attitude and support) and supporting and reinforcing structures (types and requirements). CONCLUSION: Benefit levers should be used to promote the spread of evidence-based practices. However, more studies concerning benefit levers, specifically regarding 'alignment' and 'permeation plans', are required to promote system-wide spread of best healthcare practices.","Comments":"ten Ham, Wilma Minnie, Karin van der Walt, Christa\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"ten Ham ; W  ; Minnie K ; van der Walt C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.12814","Keywords":"*Delivery of Health Care/mt [Methods]\r\n*Delivery of Health Care/st [Standards]\r\n*Evidence-Based Nursing/mt [Methods]\r\n*Evidence-Based Nursing/st [Standards]\r\n*Practice Guidelines as Topic\r\nHumans\r\nOrganizational Innovation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"ten Ham, W , Minnie K, and van der Walt C (2016) Integrative review of benefit levers' characteristics for system-wide spread of best healthcare practices.

A review of 69 articles revealed four themes: (1) attitudes toward, perceptions of, confidence in, and use of research and EBP; (2) factors that support the use of research in practice; (3) effects of interventions targeting changes in knowledge, attitudes, skills, behaviors, and evidence-based practices; and (4) identification of the processes involved in the acquisition of EBP skills and their application in clinical practice. A process that integrates client-centered practice, structured reflection, case application, and peer consultations within a scholarship of practice model facilitates occupational therapists' evaluation and integration of research evidence.","Comments":"Thomas, Aliki Law, Mary\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Thomas A ; Law M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.5014/ajot.2013.006395","Keywords":"*Evidence-Based Medicine\r\n*Health Services Research/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data]\r\n*Occupational Therapy\r\nHealth Services Research/mt [Methods]\r\nHumans","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Thomas A, and Law M (2013) Research utilization and evidence-based practice in occupational therapy: a scoping study.

BACKGROUND: As EBP competencies comprise various domains, many EBP instruments have been developed. However, instruments available in Japanese for measuring EBP have not been reported systematically. DESIGN: We conducted a scoping review. DATA SOURCES: Two different bibliography databases were searched to identify EBP instruments published until 2019: ICHUSHI (for Japanese articles) and PubMed. REVIEW METHODS: After relevant studies were screened and identified, study profile characteristics were extracted to identify EBP instruments in Japanese, and the quality of methodology for developing such instruments was evaluated. This information was recorded and the characteristics were descriptively summarized. RESULTS: Ninety potentially relevant articles were identified, of which seven articles and nine instruments were included in this review. All instruments were based on self-reported self-efficacy and attitudes. Few Japanese instruments included all the steps required for EBP. The overall reporting quality of each instrument was low. CONCLUSIONS: EBP instruments available in Japanese are extremely scarce. The study results show that it is difficult to measure the various aspects of EBP with the existing instruments.","Comments":"Tomotaki, Ai Morioka, Noriko Tsuda, Yasunobu\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tomotaki A ; Morioka N ; Tsuda Y ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/ijn.13086","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tomotaki A, Morioka N, and Tsuda Y (2022) Mapping of instruments in Japanese for measuring evidence-based practice among clinical nurses: A scoping review.

However, not all healthcare professionals and managers use EBP in their daily practice. We systematically reviewed the literature to summarise self-reported appreciation of EBP and organisational infrastructure solutions proposed to promote EBP. DESIGN: Systematic review. Two investigators independently performed the systematic reviewing process. INFORMATION SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library were searched for publications between 2000 and 2011. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INCLUDED STUDIES: Reviews and surveys of EBP attitude, knowledge, awareness, skills, barriers and facilitators among managers, doctors and nurses in clinical settings. RESULTS: We found 31 surveys of fairly good quality. General attitude towards EBP was welcoming. Respondents perceived several barriers, but also many facilitators for EBP implementation. Solutions were proposed at various organisational levels, including (inter)national associations and hospital management promoting EBP, pregraduate and postgraduate education, as well as individual support by EBP mentors on the wards to move EBP from the classroom to the bedside. CONCLUSIONS: More than 20 years after its introduction, the EBP paradigm has been embraced by healthcare professionals as an important means to improve quality of patient care, but its implementation is still deficient. Policy exerted at microlevel , middlelevel and macrolevel, and supported by professional, educational and managerial role models, may further facilitate EBP.","Comments":"Using Smart Source Parsing Jan Ubbink, Dirk T Guyatt, Gordon H Vermeulen, Hester e001881\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ubbink D T; Guyatt G H; Vermeulen H ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2012-001881","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ubbink D T, Guyatt G H, and Vermeulen H (2013) Framework of policy recommendations for implementation of evidence-based practice: a systematic scoping review.

Recently, there has been a significant push towards occupational therapists' adoption of evidence-based practice. This systematic review aimed to determine occupational therapists' attitudes, knowledge, and utilization of evidence-based practice. Method: A search of literature published between 2000-12 was conducted in relation to occupational therapists' practice. Academic Search Complete, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature Plus, PsycARTICLES, Ingenta, Medline, Science Direct, and Journal Storage were systematically searched using MeSH and free-text keywords. Google Scholar and reference lists were also searched. Findings: Thirty-two papers were selected for review: 23 were quantitative, 8 were qualitative, and 1 used a mixed methods design. Studies demonstrated that occupational therapists hold positive attitudes towards evidence-based practice. However, these attitudes do not translate into practice, with research indicating a lack of evidence-based practice utilization. Occupational therapists perceive a number of barriers to evidence-based practice, including lack of time, lack of availability and accessibility of research, and having limited research skills. Conclusion: It is essential that educational and training initiatives provide therapists with the tools and support they need to engage fully with research evidence and its application within clinical care.","Comments":"research; systematic review; tables/charts.

Scientific evidence is needed regarding interventions that support nurse leadership. AIMS: The aim was to gather, assess, and synthesize the current empirical evidence regarding interventions for enhancing nursing leadership in EBN implementation. METHODS: We conducted an integrative review of interventions that enhance the roles of nurse leaders in EBN implementation using reporting guidance according to the PRISMA statement. RESULTS: The search identified five studies, which described two intervention types: interventions improving nurse leaders' capabilities for EBN implementation and supporting the activities for EBN implementing. The interventions focused on strategic, teamwork, and individual levels. All interventions produced positive outcomes on primary outcomes, however all not statistically significant. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: The studies mainly had descriptive designs and short follow-up times, so it was not possible to propose evidence-based recommendations for effective interventions. The certainty of evidence was very low due to the study designs and the risk of bias. Structured clinical education might promote new innovations in evidence-based leadership in nursing. Conclusions about the impact of the interventions must be drawn with caution. They might be useful for promoting the abilities of nurse leaders to implement EBN, but further studies are needed to provide more reliable recommendations.","Comments":"Valimaki, Tarja Partanen, Pirjo Haggman-Laitila, Arja\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Valimaki T ; Partanen P ; Haggman-Laitila A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/wvn.12331","Keywords":"*Evidence-Based Nursing/mt [Methods]\r\n*Leadership\r\n*Nursing Care/mt [Methods]\r\nHumans\r\nOrganizational Culture","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Valimaki T, Partanen P, and Haggman-Laitila A (2018) An Integrative Review of Interventions for Enhancing Leadership in the Implementation of Evidence-Based Nursing.

BACKGROUND: Clinical decisions need to be evidence-based and understanding the knowledge sources that newly graduated nurses use will inform both education and practice. Qualitative studies on newly graduated nurses' use of knowledge sources are increasing though generated from scattered healthcare contexts. Therefore, a metasynthesis of qualitative research on what knowledge sources new graduates use in decision-making was conducted. DESIGN: Meta-ethnography. DATA SOURCES: Nineteen reports, representing 17 studies, published from 2000-2014 were identified from iterative searches in relevant databases from May 2013-May 2014. REVIEW METHODS: Included reports were appraised for quality and Noblit and Hare's meta-ethnography guided the interpretation and synthesis of data. RESULTS: Newly graduated nurses' use of knowledge sources during their first 2-year postgraduation were interpreted in the main theme 'self and others as knowledge sources,' with two subthemes 'doing and following' and 'knowing and doing,' each with several elucidating categories. The metasynthesis revealed a line of argument among the report findings underscoring progression in knowledge use and perception of competence and confidence among newly graduated nurses. CONCLUSION: The transition phase, feeling of confidence and ability to use critical thinking and reflection, has a great impact on knowledge sources incorporated in clinical decisions. The synthesis accentuates that for use of newly graduated nurses' qualifications and skills in evidence-based practice, clinical practice needs to provide a supportive environment which nurtures critical thinking and questions and articulates use of multiple knowledge sources.","Comments":"Voldbjerg, Siri Lygum Gronkjaer, Mette Sorensen, Erik Elgaard Hall, Elisabeth O C\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Voldbjerg S L; Gronkjaer M ; Sorensen E E; Hall E O; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.12914","Keywords":"*Anthropology\r\n*Nurses\r\n*Qualitative Research\r\nClinical Competence\r\nClinical Decision-Making\r\nCultural","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Voldbjerg S L, Gronkjaer M, Sorensen E E, and Hall E O (2016) Newly graduated nurses' use of knowledge sources: a meta-ethnography.

Organisational barriers relate to the workplace setting, administrational support, infrastructure, and facilities available for the retrieval, critique, summation, utilisation, and integration of research findings in health care practices and settings. OBJECTIVE: Using a scoping review approach, the organisational barriers to the implementation of EBP in health care settings were sought. METHOD: This scoping review used the first five of the six stage methodology developed by Levac et al. (2010). The five stages used are: 1) Identify the research question; 2) identify relevant studies; 3) study selection; 4) charting the data; and 5) collating, summarising and reporting the results. The following databases were searched from January 2004 until February 2014: Medline, EMBASE, EBM Reviews, Google Scholar, The Cochrane Library and CINAHL. RESULTS: Of the 49 articles included in this study, there were 29 cross-sectional surveys, six descriptions of specific interventions, seven literature reviews, four narrative reviews, nine qualitative studies, one ethnographic study and one systematic review. The articles were analysed and five broad organisational barriers were identified. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review sought to map the breadth of information available on the organisational barriers to the use of EBP in health care settings. Even for a health care professional who is motivated and competent in the use of EBP; all of these barriers will impact on their ability to increase and maintain their use of EBP in the workplace.","Comments":"Williams, Brett Perillo, Samuel Brown, Ted S0260-6917(14)00381-5\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Williams B ; Perillo S ; Brown T ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2014.11.012","Keywords":"*Evidence-Based Practice\r\n*Guideline Adherence\r\n*Health Facility Administration\r\n*Organizational Culture\r\nHealth Personnel/px [Psychology]\r\nHumans","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Williams B, Perillo S, and Brown T (2015) What are the factors of organisational culture in health care settings that act as barriers to the implementation of evidence-based practice?

No systematic review has explored whether this educational input translates into improved patient outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To review the evidence on (1) The change in patient outcomes following educational interventions to support practising nurses in implementing EBP. (2) The instruments or methods used to determine whether EBP education improves patient outcomes. METHODS: A systematic review following PRISMA guidance was conducted. Literature was comprehensive searched including 6 databases, journal handsearching, citation tracking, and grey literature websites. Studies were included if they reported an EBP educational intervention aimed at practising nurses and contained objective or self-reported measures of patient related outcomes. The quality of the included studies was assessed using a modified Health Care Practice R&D Unit (HCPRDU) tool. Because of the poor homogeneity of the included studies, the data were analysed by narrative synthesis. RESULTS: Of the 4284 articles identified, 18 were included: 12 pre-post studies, three qualitative studies, and three mixed-methods study designs. The level of quality was modest in the studies. The results of the EBP educational interventions on patient outcomes were assessed using three methods: individual projects to implement an evidence-based approach, qualitative approaches, and a questionnaire survey. The majority of the articles concluded there was a positive change in patient outcomes following an educational intervention to improve EBP; a wide range of context specific outcomes were described. CONCLUSION: Educational interventions for clinical nurses to support the implementation of EBP show promise in improving patient outcomes. However, the direct impact of EBP interventions on clinical outcomes is difficult to measure. Further testing and development is needed to improve the quality of studies and evaluation instruments in order to confirm the current findings.","Comments":"Wu, Yanni Brettle, Alison Zhou, Chunlan Ou, Jiexia Wang, Yanfang Wang, Siqi S0260-6917(18)30473-8\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wu Y ; Brettle A ; Zhou C ; Ou J ; Wang Y ; Wang S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2018.08.026","Keywords":"*Evidence-Based Practice/mt [Methods]\r\n*Health Knowledge\r\n*Health Personnel/ed [Education]\r\n*Nurses\r\n*Patient Outcome Assessment\r\nAttitudes\r\nClinical Competence\r\nDelivery of Health Care\r\nHumans\r\nPractice","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wu Y, Brettle A, Zhou C, Ou J, Wang Y, and Wang S (2018) Do educational interventions aimed at nurses to support the implementation of evidence-based practice improve patient outcomes?

Method: To identify useful studies, a search of PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web-science was performed. For the analysis, STATA 16 has been employed. The funnel plot and Egger's regression test statistic have been used to find potential reporting bias, while I2 was employed to confirm inter-study heterogeneity. A random-effect model has been used to contrast summary effects, odds ratios, and 95% confidence intervals all over research findings. Result: The pooled estimate of evidence-based practice among health professionals in Ethiopia was 42.94% (95%CI: 30.03–55.85). Good Knowledge (AOR = 2.38; 95% CI:1.82,3.12),had internet access(AOR = 1.81; 95%CI:1.38,2.38), took training(AOR = 2.45; 95% CI:1.47,4.08), had good communication skill(AOR = 2.28; 95% CI: 1.94, 2.67),availability of free time (AOR = 3.31; 95%CI:1.39, 7.87) and marital status single(AOR = 1.77; 95% CI:1.26,2.47) were statistically associated with evidence based practice of health professionals. Conclusion and recommendation: This systematic review and meta-analysis found that about forty-three percent of respondents utilized evidence-based practices for patient care. Knowledge, training, and internet access were identified as factors associated with evidence-based practice among health professionals in Ethiopia. This study suggests the need to conduct provision of training and capacity building, mentoring on the competence of health professionals in evidence-based practice.","Comments":"L2019203330 2022-07-14\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wubante S M; Tegegne M D; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imu.2022.101012","Keywords":"Ethiopia\r\nMedline\r\nScopus\r\nWeb of Science\r\nadult\r\ncapacity building\r\ncommunication skill\r\nevidence based practice center\r\nfemale\r\nhuman\r\ninternet access\r\nmale\r\nmarriage\r\nmentoring\r\npatient care\r\nreporting bias\r\nreview\r\nsearch engine\r\nsingle (marital status)\r\nsystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wubante S M, and Tegegne M D (2022) Evidence-based practice and its associated factors among health professionals in Ethiopia: Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Strategies for enhancing EIDM have been synthesized in high-quality systematic reviews, yet most relate to physicians or mixed disciplines. Existing reviews, specific to nursing, have not captured a broad range of strategies for promoting the knowledge and skills for EIDM, patient outcomes as a result of EIDM, or contextual information for why these strategies \"work.\" AIM: To conduct a scoping review to identify and map the literature related to strategies implemented among nurses in tertiary care for promoting EIDM knowledge, skills, and behaviours, as well as patient outcomes and contextual implementation details. METHODS: A search strategy was developed and executed to identify relevant research evidence. Participants included registered nurses, clinical nurse specialists, nurse practitioners, and advanced practice nurses. Strategies were those enhancing nurses' EIDM knowledge, skills, or behaviours, as well as patient outcomes. Relevant studies included systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, cluster randomized controlled trials, non-randomized trials (including controlled before and after studies), cluster non-randomized trials, interrupted time series designs, prospective cohort studies, mixed-method studies, and qualitative studies. Two reviewers performed study selection and data extraction using standardized forms. Disagreements were resolved through discussion or third party adjudication. RESULTS: Using a narrative synthesis, the body of research was mapped by design, clinical areas, strategies, and provider and patient outcomes to determine areas appropriate for a systematic review. CONCLUSIONS: There are a sufficiently high number of studies to conduct a more focused systematic review by care settings, study design, implementation strategies, or outcomes. A focused review could assist in determining which strategies can be recommended for enhancing EIDM knowledge, skills, and behaviours among nurses in tertiary care.","Comments":"Yost, Jennifer Thompson, David Ganann, Rebecca Aloweni, Fazila Newman, Kristine McKibbon, Ann Dobbins, Maureen Ciliska, Donna","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Yost J ; Thompson D ; Ganann R ; Aloweni F ; Newman K ; McKibbon A ; Dobbins M ; Ciliska D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/wvn.12043","Keywords":"*Decision Making\r\n*Evidence-Based Nursing/mt [Methods]\r\n*Evidence-Based Nursing/st [Standards]\r\n*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice\r\nHumans\r\n*Quality Improvement","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Yost J, Thompson D, Ganann R, Aloweni F, Newman K, McKibbon A, Dobbins M, and Ciliska D (2014) Knowledge translation strategies for enhancing nurses' evidence-informed decision making: a scoping review.

Despite an improved awareness about EIDM, there is a lack of use of research evidence and understanding about the effectiveness of interventions to promote EIDM. This project aimed to discover if knowledge translation (KT) interventions directed to nurses in tertiary care are effective for improving EIDM knowledge, skills, behaviours, and, as a result, client outcomes. It also sought to understand contextual factors that affect the impact of such interventions. METHODS: A systematic review funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (PROSPERO registration: CRD42013003319) was conducted. Included studies examined the implementation of any KT intervention involving nurses in tertiary care to promote EIDM knowledge, skills, behaviours, and client outcomes or studies that examined contextual factors. Study designs included systematic reviews, quantitative, qualitative, and mixed method studies. The search included electronic databases and manual searching of published and unpublished literature to November 2012; key databases included MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Excerpta Medica (EMBASE). Two reviewers independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment, and data extraction. Studies with quantitative data determined to be clinically homogeneous were synthesized using meta-analytic methods. Studies with quantitative data not appropriate for meta-analysis were synthesized narratively by outcome. Studies with qualitative data were synthesized by theme. RESULTS: Of the 44,648 citations screened, 30 citations met the inclusion criteria (18 quantitative, 10 qualitative, and 2 mixed methods studies). The quality of studies with quantitative data ranged from very low to high, and quality criteria was generally met for studies with qualitative data. No studies evaluated the impact on knowledge and skills; they primarily investigated the effectiveness of multifaceted KT strategies for promoting EIDM behaviours and improving client outcomes. Almost all studies included an educational component. A meta-analysis of two studies determined that a multifaceted intervention (educational meetings and use of a mentor) did not increase engagement in a range of EIDM behaviours [mean difference 2.7, 95 % CI (-1.7 to 7.1), I (2) = 0 %]. Among the remaining studies, no definitive conclusions could be made about the relative effectiveness of the KT interventions due to variation of interventions and outcomes, as well as study limitations. Findings from studies with qualitative data identified the organizational, individual, and interpersonal factors, as well as characteristics of the innovation, that influence the success of implementation. CONCLUSIONS: KT interventions are being implemented and evaluated on nurses' behaviour and client outcomes. This systematic review may inform the selection of KT interventions and outcomes among nurses in tertiary care and decisions about further research.","Comments":"Yost, Jennifer Ganann, Rebecca Thompson, David Aloweni, Fazila Newman, Kristine Hazzan, Afeez McKibbon, Ann Dobbins, Maureen Ciliska, Donna\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Yost J ; Ganann R ; Thompson D ; Aloweni F ; Newman K ; Hazzan A ; McKibbon A ; Dobbins M ; Ciliska D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13012-015-0286-1","Keywords":"*Evidence-Based Nursing/mt [Methods]\r\n*Tertiary Healthcare/mt [Methods]\r\n*Translational Research\r\nBiomedical/mt [Methods]\r\nDecision Making\r\nHumans\r\nProgram Development\r\nProgram Evaluation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Yost J, Ganann R, Thompson D, Aloweni F, Newman K, Hazzan A, McKibbon A, Dobbins M, and Ciliska D (2015) The effectiveness of knowledge translation interventions for promoting evidence-informed decision-making among nurses in tertiary care: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

This overview systematically evaluated and organized evidence from systematic reviews on teaching evidence-based health care (EBHC). METHODS/FINDINGS: We searched for systematic reviews evaluating interventions for teaching EBHC to health professionals compared to no intervention or different strategies. Outcomes covered EBHC knowledge, skills, attitudes, practices and health outcomes. Comprehensive searches were conducted in April 2013. Two reviewers independently selected eligible reviews, extracted data and evaluated methodological quality. We included 16 systematic reviews, published between 1993 and 2013. There was considerable overlap across reviews. We found that 171 source studies included in the reviews related to 81 separate studies, of which 37 are in more than one review. Studies used various methodologies to evaluate educational interventions of varying content, format and duration in undergraduates, interns, residents and practicing health professionals. The evidence in the reviews showed that multifaceted, clinically integrated interventions, with assessment, led to improvements in knowledge, skills and attitudes. Interventions improved critical appraisal skills and integration of results into decisions, and improved knowledge, skills, attitudes and behaviour amongst practicing health professionals. Considering single interventions, EBHC knowledge and attitude were similar for lecture-based versus online teaching. Journal clubs appeared to increase clinical epidemiology and biostatistics knowledge and reading behavior, but not appraisal skills. EBHC courses improved appraisal skills and knowledge. Amongst practicing health professionals, interactive online courses with guided critical appraisal showed significant increase in knowledge and appraisal skills. A short workshop using problem-based approaches, compared to no intervention, increased knowledge but not appraisal skills. CONCLUSIONS: EBHC teaching and learning strategies should focus on implementing multifaceted, clinically integrated approaches with assessment. Future rigorous research should evaluate minimum components for multifaceted interventions, assessment of medium to long-term outcomes, and implementation of these interventions.","Comments":"Young, Taryn Rohwer, Anke Volmink, Jimmy Clarke, Mike\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Young T ; Rohwer A ; Volmink J ; Clarke M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0086706","Keywords":"*Evidence-Based Medicine/ed [Education]\r\nEducation\r\nGraduate\r\nHumans\r\nMedical\r\nProfessional Competence","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Young T, Rohwer A, Volmink J, and Clarke M (2014) What are the effects of teaching evidence-based health care (EBHC)?

Within Low- and Middle-Income countries (LMICs) access is limited due to financial and structural constraints within countries and institutions. Reduced access to research literature limits the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals through its impact on the education of healthcare staff and on the development of contextually appropriate evidence for practice. OBJECTIVE: To identify the challenges and possible solutions for accessing scholarly literature among medical and nursing professionals and students in low-and-middle income countries. DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, CINAHL PLUS, ERIC, ASSIA, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. REVIEW METHODS: Five bibliography databases were searched using relevant search terms, from January 2002 to July 2022. Additional searches were carried out in Google Scholar. Titles, abstracts, and full texts were independently screened by at least two authors, based on predefined eligibility criteria. Pertinent data were extracted from included studies, and critical appraisal was undertaken. Data were analysed and presented in a narrative approach. RESULTS: Five papers met the inclusion criteria and were included. Three aspects of challenges at different levels emerged: infrastructure and institutional level factors, individual factors, and lack of contextually appropriate evidence. Three solutions were identified: capacity development opportunities, improving Internet access, and increasing awareness of free resources. CONCLUSION: This review provides an overview of common barriers medical and nursing professionals and students encounter whilst accessing scholarly literature in LMICs and identifies some possible solutions to address them. The findings can be used to guide institutions, as well as national and international decision makers to elicit policy which can promote the uptake of research in LMICs. Further research should focus on how these solutions could be harnessed to address the problems identified in this review.","Comments":"Zhang, Mengying Doi, Lawrence Awua, Joshua Asare, Hayford Stenhouse, Rosie S0260-6917(23)00031-X\r\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zhang M ; Doi L ; Awua J ; Asare H ; Stenhouse R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2023.105737","Keywords":"*Delivery of Health Care\r\n*Developing Countries\r\nHumans\r\nStudents","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zhang M, Doi L, Awua J, Asare H, and Stenhouse R (2023) Challenges and possible solutions for accessing scholarly literature among medical and nursing professionals and students in low-and-middle income countries: A systematic review.

Little is known about its development in China. This study aims to provide an overview of the EBP implementation research progress in healthcare in China and identify gaps for future studies. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review following the Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review methodology and the Cochrane Collaboration's guidance on living reviews. We performed a literature search in four Chinese databases (i.e., China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wan Fang Database, The VIP Database, and China Biology Medicine) and three English databases (i.e., Ovid MEDLINE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and EMBASE), Google scholar, and Baidu scholar from 1996 to 2021. We included EBP implementation studies conducted in healthcare settings in China and were published in Chinese and English literature. The search will be run on a regular basis to monitor the development of new literature and determine when to update the review. FINDINGS: Of the 11,276 records identified, we finally included 309 papers. The publications were on a sharp rise since 2013 and were predominantly from the nursing field (292/309, 94.50%). The commonly researched areas were symptom management (75/309, 24.27%), tube care (46/309, 14.89%), perioperative care (43/309, 13.92%), and fundamental care (43/309, 13.92%). Joanna Briggs Institute model was the most frequently used model to guide the implementation process (92/159, 59.75%). A median number of 8 people often comprised an implementation team, with 113 studies (36.57%) taking a multidisciplinary approach. 204 studies reported utilizing audit criteria to assist evaluation of evidence implementation rate with diversified methods measuring the criteria. Lack of knowledge, skills, and resources, and incomplete procedures or pathways were top barriers impeding EBP implementation. Leadership support was considered the most common facilitator. Education and training were the most frequently described implementation strategies for healthcare professionals and patients. Optimizing workflows and developing evaluation tools were the primary strategies adopted by organizations. 291 studies measured patient outcomes and 174 studies measured healthcare professional outcomes. INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, this scoping review is the first one to systematically examine the EBP implementation research progress in healthcare in China. Based on this review, we identified contributions that Chinese EBP implementation research made to the global community, and provided eight recommendations for Chinese researchers in conducting implementation studies in the future.
